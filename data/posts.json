Now, it seems clear we didn’t\ndo our homework and forgot to learn from the past mistakes. Precisely seventy\nyears after the Ukrainian disaster, the in-air explosion of Google’s latest\niteration of their Mars III space shuttle has finally brought a winter to\ntropical Scandinavian countries. Although no one could predict that the desired\ncooling will be a nuclear one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As The Times reported yesterday, the\ninvestigative commission finished the final report. Led by Dr. Fineman, who is\na professor emerita at the Institute for Higher Learning and well-respected\nexpert in the field of applied physics, the group presented the findings into\nthe probable causes of the explosion. Dr. Fineman is quoted saying that she was\nstruck by the unimaginable series of errors and irresponsibility found in\nGoogle’s documents. By the tech giant’s own standards, the new compact nuclear\nfusion reactor with its unusual beta configuration shouldn’t have been used\nbecause it failed all the three mandatory tests before the lift-off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google has been experiencing serious\ntechnical and privacy issues in recent years. The infamous hacking incident to\nits YouLive social network powered by the breakthrough machine-brain chip\ninterface is still hotly debated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The social network YouLive\nexperienced a massive leak of brain login information of more than a million\nusers. The hacker took advantage of poorly secured private brain streams of\nYouLive users during the most intimate personal moments, including a sexual\nintercourse. With the unlimited access to the brain streams of many victims,\nthe hacker set up an app where he was offering the access to these brain\nstreams to other women. The Department of Cyber Security and Brain Interfaces\nwas flabbergasted to learn that the majority of users of the app were women\nfrom professional backgrounds who are reportedly suffering from a sudden onset\nof asexuality. These women belong to an increasing population of well-of women\nwho use other women’s brain streams to artificially regain sexual sensations\nthat they themselves had lost long time ago. This hacking wasn’t illegal\nbecause it was intended to benefit the vulnerable communities of professional\nwomen. Google itself condoned this act as a brilliant case of digital activism.\nBut soon it became known the app was also used by men who exploited all\ninvolved for their illegal sexist activities. At that moment Google reacted\nspeedily and was given a permission to prosecute those men. Even though many\nreceived their life sentences, the damage to the reputation couldn’t be undone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a blow to the public’s trust\nin the tech giant’s ability to secure the transmission of our most intimate\nthoughts and sensations between friends, family, and love partners. The\nsituation eroded further when Google decided to dismiss two high-ranking female\nemployees and instead hired Jacob Mao-Hong to be an interim chief officer of\nengineering. This step was widely condemned by professional Twitter\ncommentators. The US vice-president for diversity, issued an official\ngovernment response that the decision to exchange two female employees for one\nman may be unconstitutional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The culmination of Google’s problems\ncomes back to last week’s explosion watched by the entire world online. The\nanticipation was ecstatic because Google boasted that the new fusion reactor\nengine would shorten the fly time to Mars by half. Such technological leap was\ngoing to be the ultimate step towards making commercial travel to Mars a viable\nreality. Instead we saw a sudden flash of white sharp light followed by an\nominous fire ball. While the picture was terrifying, the video stream was cut\nat instance and the viewers were kept safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That cannot be said about the\ninhabitants of Scandinavian countries in the Northern Europe below the\ntrajectory of the shuttle. Dr. Fineman and her group of collaborators have\ngathered the preliminary number of the casualties. Apart from the twelve brave\nAmerican crew members on the board of the Mars III shuttle, thousands died\nimmediately after the explosion due to the radiation or were swept away by the\ninevitable shockwave that destroyed houses, schools, churches, offices and\nother structures on the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US president M. Sue, her wife,\nand other US government officials already travelled to Europe to discuss the\nsituation with their counterparts. The US delegation emphasized its commitment\nto prolong the social media ban on distressing content related to the accident\nin all Western hemisphere at least for the next three months. They also met the\ninjured at the hospitals across Scandinavia and offered their condolences after\nthe incident. The president M. Sue promised on the behalf of our country to pay\nfor the expenses of clearing up the catastrophe. However, the Eastern bloc of\nthe European continent with its sizable population of white American immigrants\nwas staging protest marches in all major capitals. Budapest, Warsaw, and other\ncities joined the Moscow to condemn the alleged Western human rights abuses and\ndiscrimination against white and Asian minorities. The “white curtain” bloc\nwith Moscow it the lead even suggested at the hastily summoned UN meeting that\nthe systemic discrimination in the US directly contributed to the shuttle\nexploding. Having supplied no evidence for such outrageous claims, it would be\ndismissed as mere propaganda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evidence, however, has piled up\nin last days. Dr. Fineman and her team revealed in Google’s internal\ncommunication that the leadership knew well about the failed tests. Google\ndecided to go ahead with the project nevertheless because it refused to believe\nthat the testing team should have the power to intervene with the plans. This\nunorthodox move was perplexing to Dr. Fineman’s investigation because, to the\ncontrary, this was the testing team’s primary role. According to the documents\nmonitoring the performance of employees, over last years the testing team did\ncaught many blatant mistakes, preventing other possible tragic incidents. While\npresenting this finding to the public on the government video stream inside the\ncourt room of Google executives and public officials, Dr. Fineman asked why\nthese particular tests of the new fusion reactor engine were ignored when the\nprevious test results were accepted and integrated into the next versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CEO of Google, Anita Gupta,\nreplied with a prepared statement. She said that Google followed the new\nlegislature requiring tech companies in Sillicon Valley to have sufficiently\ndiverse working groups to generate valid results. And because the test team handling\nthe tests of the nuclear reactor engine had more than thirty percent of white,\nheterosexual males, the tests were invalid due to the lack of diversity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Fineman continued with her\ninterrogation and asked what happened next when they decided to discard the\ntest results. The head of Human Resources commented that her department was\nresponsible to find more diverse candidates, which they did in next two days.\nIt was at this moment where Dr. Fineman went back to her table and looked over\na few sheets of paper and asked her colleagues to confirm her suspicion that\ntwo days were a short time to find new candidates for such an important task.\nThe head of HR continued that it was indeed a situation that they needed to\nsolve quickly so that they could finish the tests. To be consistent with the\ninternal policy at Google, the HR department decided to use brain scans and paper-and-pencil\ntests to assess the cognitive abilities of the candidates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Fineman asked about what kind of\ntests were used. At this moment Anita Gupta interrupted to clarify and\nemphasize that Google uses only the legal tests that assess the verbal ability\nof the candidates. Dr. Fineman asked how long they had been using this specific\ntest. Gupta again answered instead of her HR colleague that Google started to\nuse only the verbal part of cognitive assessment right after the government\npassed the law which prohibited to discriminate job applicants based on their\nmathematical and visual-spatial abilities, having been used previously with the\nminorities failing the most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next day, Dr. Fineman brought to the\ncourt room a large white printed graph. There was a red and blue line that showed\nthe relationship between the number of mistakes Google internally made during\nlast years and the hired people that were given only the verbal part of the\ncognitive assessment test. The lines followed each other perfectly, both having\nan increasing slope as the years went by. So far Dr. Fineman always had a stone-cold\nface, delivering her remarks calmly as we would expect from an experienced academic.\nBut this morning she had visible wrinkles on her forehead and sleepy eyelids. Her\nlips were weak and drained of colour. She accompanied her words with frequent sips\nof purified water. Stepping out of her usual booth, she took some time before\ncontinuing:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The lines we can see on my\nwhiteboard look innocent but show a relationship between two important things.\nI have noticed this pattern myself some time ago and worries me greatly. Of\ncourse, we all learned that correlation doesn’t equal causation and this rule\nmust be applied also in this case. However, if we stop for a moment and imagine\nthere <em>is</em> a causation, can we explain it?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Fineman continued: “It’s been\nover two decades when the famous Ocasio-Cortez commission brought together\nexperts from the field of psychometrics and ruled that mathematical and\nvisual-spatial tests are biased in favour of men. And especially white and Asian\nmen. It was decided that these results go against the official state policy of\nequity and progressive democratic values. The test were kept but only their\npart that made a path to equitable results. But I wonder if Albert Einstein,\nthe famous physicist of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, wasn’t correct when he\nsaid that doing physics is not a verbal process at all but needs visual\nimagination and mental rotation of abstract objects and concepts. Only later do\nwords and meanings come into play solving the puzzle. Physics, programming and\nall kinds of engineering need all the human talents and if we decide to cherish\nonly of them and base our technological future on it, we may face an unintended\nconsequences”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state prosecutor interrupted Dr.\nFineman’s monologue and said that to suggest any relationship between Google’s\ntechnical mistakes and the cognitive assessment test would go against the scientific\nconsensus that the verbal tests are the most equitable ones and thus provide\nthe best cognitive assessment for hiring practices, in tech and elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Fineman took a pause before agreeing\nthat the verbal tests are the best choice for equity. But she continued: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My dear comrades, we all work and struggle to fulfil the promises of our parents to rebuild our nation on the bedrock of equity and solidarity. My training in physics taught me, however, the physical world doesn’t care about the social goals we have embedded into the fabric of our constitution. It has own rules and politics. The physical world showed us that shuttles explode even though we tell ourselves they shouldn’t. Likewise, we have bright and talented people of diverse backgrounds. But for them to reach their potential, we must ensure they have equally an opportunity to do what they excel at. The conclusion of our investigation reveals that the nuclear catastrophe, the tragic loss of thousands of lives, many our technological problems and looming stagnation in innovation compared to China, Japan, Korea or even our adversaries in the Eastern Europe are results of our decision to forget the full picture of what it means to be a human.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the presentation, the hearing\nwas adjourned abruptly.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ever since the most dreadful nuclear catastrophe in the peoplekind history that happened in the small Soviet city of Chernobyl, we have had the question on our minds.

Je to porucha, které se říká afantazie.  Tato porucha byla v poslední době zpopularizována programátorem prohlížeče Firefox, Blakem Rossem v jeho hojně sdíleném FB příspěvku: “Aphantasia: How It Feels To Be Blind In Your Mind”. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p> Francis Galton již v roce 1880 zkoumal, jak si lidé dokáží v hlavě představovat mentální obrazy. Ve svém článku překvapivě konstatuje, že když se ptal svých kolegů vědců na toto téma, většina z nich si myslela, že si z nich Galton dělá legraci, že nic takového jako „mentální obraz neexistuje“. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nedávno jsem někde četl, že Jerry Fodor reagoval stejně, když se s kolegy poprvé bavil o mentálních obrazech. Fodor byl tak přesvědčen, že nic takového neexistuje, že považoval ty tzv. mentální obrazy za výmysl a vtip svých kolegů.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pokud Fodor sám dokázal myslet “pouze v jazyce, tedy verbálně, není pak pravděpodobné, že nevyhnutelně musel přijít s teorií, které tvrdí, že princip obecného lidského myšlení se podobá, nebo snad dokonce je jazyk podobný přirozenému jazyku? To je totiž Fodorova známá hypotéza &#8222;jazyka myšlení” (language of thought).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Protikladem k Fodorově lineárnímu, logickému a syntaktickému “jazyku myšlení” je pak teorie mentálních modelů Philipa Johnson-Lairda. Jeho mentální modely jsou naopak vizuální, prostorové, asociativní, diagramatické, vyjádřením myšlení v prostoru za pomoci vztahů mezi objekty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oba způsoby myšlení jsou důležité. Je jasné, že většina lidí bude mít schopnost používat oba způsobu, i když každý bude preferovat jeden z nich, neboť bude dominantnější a vyvinutější.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Díky&nbsp;<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fkriss.ag.9%3F__tn__%3D%252CdK-R-R%26eid%3DARBWGLzmGh1z9lBe6kpMeEHDsoxPRvt23V6NLL5d0ucpwyxTZmg4YAzTOh9YTtVV9ZTi45HLuoVLmi-t%26fref%3Dmentions&amp;t=MDgwMWJmYWI0YmE3N2U2YmY1MWJlZWViMjZlMDY0MTdmZDhhYWYzZCxRQ1l2SkpCRg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AIC5wtPin8W9DkiBKliDgcA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fodkladiste.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F184207256275%2Fo-dvou-zp%25C5%25AFsobech-my%25C5%25A1len%25C3%25AD-a-kulturn%25C3%25AD-eugenice&amp;m=1\">Cristina Aguillón</a>&nbsp;jsem se dozvěděl o poruše Afázie, které se objevuje u lidí, kteří si prošli mozkovým infarktem a část mozku jim odumřela. V závislosti na závažnosti a rozsahu infarktu ztratí tito lidé částečně nebo úplně schopnost mluvit, číst a psát. Původně se myslelo, že inteligence těchto lidí jinak zůstává neporušena, nicméně současné výzkumy lidí s afázií na neverbálních testech ukazují pokles inteligence i na úkolech nevyžadující žádný jazyk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Říkám si, že v naší společnosti lidé bez jazyka jsou více méně ztraceni, nebo mají minimálně enormní problémy, zatímco lidé bez schopnosti mentální představivosti žijou často úspěšné životy bez toho, aniž by si uvědomili, že jim chybí jeden způsob lidského uvažování.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Něco mi říká, že afantazie bude běžnější než se zdá. Dokonce si myslím, že zhruba po Gutenbergovi se biokulturní selekce postarala o to, že lidé s afantazií byli preferováni, zatímco lidé s afázií nebo podobnou verbální poruchou měli problém si opatřit partnery a potomky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Existují etnické skupiny, které historicky kladly kulturně tak zásadní důraz na verbální způsob myšlení, že průměrná úroveň jejich verbální inteligence se během stovek let postupně navyšovala, zatímco jejich vizuálně-prostorová inteligence stagnovala, ba dokonce se zhoršovala, neb jednoduše pro jejich kulturní zvyky, práci, vzdělání a přežití nebyla potřeba. Je náhoda, že Ross i Fodor k jedné z této etnické skupiny patři?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tím se dostávám k tomu nejzajímavějšímu, co poslední dobou zaměstnává mou mysl: kultura a její požadavky na určité kognitivní dovednosti je selektivní mechanismem, který určuje, jaké geny a tedy i jaké kognitivní schopnosti a způsoby myšlení se budou v budoucích generacích preferovat. Pokud daná kultura zůstane relativně stabilní, můžeme očekávat, že tyto kognitivní dovednosti se budou zpětnovazebním mechanismem více a více preferovat a také u lidí zlepšovat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Některé kultury to dělaly nevědomě, někteří diktátoři se o to snažili vědomě a násilně. V obou případech se ale tomuto mechanismu a procesu selekce určitých dovedností, především těch kognitivních říká jedním slovem: eugenika.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kultura jako selektivní mechanismus našich genů může být eugenická nebo dysgenická. To znamená, může preferovat takové vlastnosti, které my v Západní společnosti považujeme za pozitivní (inteligence, flexibilní flexibilita myšlení, kreativita) nebo za negativní.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Já se momentálně soustředím jen na jednu malou, ale vlivnou část naší kultury, která ovlivňuje naše myšlení teď a tady, ale také nastoluje určité kulturní mechanismy pro preferování určitého způsobu myšlení, a tou částí je technologie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mojí nejdivočejší hypotézou hraničící s technologickým determinismem je, že se na historii můžeme dívat metodou, kdy velké kulturní a sociální změny můžeme hledat v tom, jak technologie a další kulturní artefakty působily jako selektivní mechanismy pro daný způsob myšlení a kognitivních dovedností. Pokud toto přijmeme, pak dále následuje, že různé technologie zapřičinily, že se uvnitř různých kultur postupem času vyvíjely kognitivní dovednosti jinak:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Různé kultury si vypracují odlišné selektivní mechanismy dovedností a způsobů myšlení (tj. i genů)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sociální konstruktivisté mají pravdu. Inteligence je socio-kulturní konstrukt. Ale možná jiným způsobem, než si přáli a zamýšleli.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Známý filosof mysli Jerry Fodor byl jeden z těch, kteří nebyli schopni si v mysli vytvářet mentální obrazy.

Přestože analytické myšlení spadá do designérova repertoáru potřebných dovedností, je to právě jeho schopnost najít a přiřadit k danému problému vhodné řešení, co liší designéra od vědce.</p>\n<p>Vědec se zajímá o vyložení toho, jak daná věc nebo proces <strong>skutečně </strong>fungují. Pro takové zkoumání má věda aparát kontrolovaného experimentování a dvojici deduktivního a induktivního myšlení. Tyto metody vědci slouží k tomu, aby odkryly na první pohled skryté zákonitosti. Ty pak vědec se snaží racionálním, tedy logicko-matematickým způsobem vysvětlit tak, že popíše, jak fungují krok za krokem. Jinak řečeno, výsledkem vědecké činnosti je vlastně tvorba obsáhlé kuchařky, která obsahuje postupy toho, jak věci ve světě fungují. A tyto recepty musí být ideálně natolik přesné, aby kdokoli, za předpokladu, že bude věrně následovat všechny postupy a podmínky, byl schopný ověřit funkčnost receptu tím, že se dobere stejného výsledku. Pokud recept lze přesně replikovat, znamená to jednak, že funguje, ale také to odkrývá něco hlubšího o tom, jak se věda dívá na svět: pokud se vždycky dobereme stejného výsledku, recept v sobě ztělesňuje něco <strong>pravdivého </strong>o fungování světa. Pravda ve vědě je již od dob Newtona ovlivněna mechanistickým pohledem na svět, a to i dnes, kdy Newtonova fyzika, ze které mechanistický pohled vychází, byla překonána přesnějšími teoriemi. Mechanistickým světem se myslí to, že cílem vědy je dobrat se k jasně definovaným receptům obsahující pravidla a postupy, které můžeme explicitně následovat a dobrat se očekávaného výsledku. Věda je analytická a jejím ideálem je nalezení pravdivých faktů a procesů světa.</p>\n<p>V případě designu se musí hned zkraje říct, že nestojí v opozici ke vědě, protože designový proces samozřejmě analytickou část vyžaduje, především v prvotní fázi procesu často věnované sběru požadavků, cílů, technických, právních a dalších omezení. Na druhou stranu design není obor, který by pouze parazitoval na zavedených oborech „tvrdých“ nebo humanitních věd tím, že by užíval jejich metody a nepřinášel nic nového. Tak tomu není. Designéři se vyznačují něčím unikátním a to schopností uhníst z nesourodého a často protichůdného seznamu požadavků a omezení finální produkt, který v materiální nebo digitální podobě <strong>syntetizuje výše zmíněné v koherentní, funkční a často i esteticky stimulující celek</strong>.<strong> </strong>Tato <strong>designová syntéza</strong> vzít hromadu nesourodého a vytvořit z toho nový celek je tak fundamentální pro celý obor, že bez ní si lze design těžko představit. Zároveň tato schopnost není limitována předmětem, na který ji designéři aplikují. I proto vidíme v posledních patnácti letech rozmach designového myšlení v byznysu, ve zdravotnictví, ve školách apod. Bylo to světoznámé inovační studio IDEO, které svým <strong>designem zaměřeným na člověka</strong> (Human-centered design, HCD)<strong> </strong>dostalo design mimo zdi studií, které se orientovaly na tradiční designového obory.</p>\n<p>Design ale není pouze a jen syntéza a proces k ní vedoucí. Rozeberme si, co přesně designová syntéza předpokládá. Člověk musí na začátku procesu být připraven, že má před sebou úkol, pro který neexistuje jasně definované zadání, ale dokonce ani jasně definovaný finální výsledek. Jistě, klient nebo instituce, pro kterou designér něco vytváří, vždycky v zadání projektu definují, jaký výsledek očekávají. Ale designérské problémy jsou málokdy specifikovány vyčerpávajícím způsobem, naopak často je očekávaný výsledek popsán vágním a nepřesným způsobem: například stylem „chceme zlepšit prodej online obchodu“ nebo „potřebuji, aby naše služby vyvolávaly v zákaznících lepší uživatelské zážitky“. Nejedná se tedy problémy mající jasně dané řešení, na které narazíme ve vědě, matematice nebo logice. Nejasnost a ambivalence designu vyžaduje člověka, který po psychické stránce dokáže překonat strach z nejistoty a ambivalence. Ne každý má takový psychologická profil, a proto design přitahuje především lidi, kteří <strong>z chaotického stavu věcí </strong>rádi<strong> vytváří řád</strong>, který je preferovaným stavem věcí</p>\n<p>Pokud je fundamentálním procesem designu přeměna chaosu na řád, musíme se ptát, co designérům pomáhá, aby tento nelehký a pro mnoho lidí zastrašující úkol zvládli. Myslím, že tuto otázku lze položit i jinak: co přesně dělí zkušeného designéra od nováčka, respektive jaké dovednosti, znalosti a formu zkušeností musí designér mít, aby se mohl považovat za zkušeného?</p>\n<p>Triviální odpovědí by bylo říct, že zkušeného designéra od amatéra (nebo ne-designéra) odděluje to, že zkušený designér se prostě a jednoduše věnuje tomuto oboru déle. Takové odpověď, jakkoli povrchní, v sobě obsahuje pravdivé jádro. Nicméně to nám nemůže stačit. Proto se musíme ptát jinak: co si zkušený designér za dobu svého působení vybuduje, že v určité chvíli se stává odborníkem?</p>\n<p>V úvodu jsme si řekli, že designér neřeší problémy nekonečnou analýzou, nýbrž navrhuje řešení. Designér je tak odborníkem na nacházení řešení na nejasně a vágně definované problémy. I když je design kreativní činností, každý obor si nevyhnutelně za vypracuje určité hranice a ověřené postupy, které definují obor samotný. Tyto ověřené postupy nazvěme <strong>designovými patterny </strong>po vzoru teoretika architektury Christophera Alexandera, který tento pojem do diskurzu teorie designu a architektury zavedl. Každý designér si v průběhu své činnosti totiž začne všímat, že určité problémy lze řešit pomocí řešení, které aplikoval na zdánlivě odlišný úkol v minulosti. Postupem času si designér všímá více a více toho, co mají problémy společné a zjišťuje, že pro ušetření času a kreativní energie se vyplatí část problému automaticky vyřešit aplikací hotových řešení a to, co je na problému skutečně nové a náročné, tomu designér věnuje nejvíce času. Hotová řešení nebo designové patterny ale designér nemusí čerpat pouze ze svého repertoáru. Každý designér je součástí dlouhé genealogie předchozích designérů, kteří řešili podobné problémy a také si vypracovali své patterny. Tyto patterny buďto nalezneme zmíněné v nějaké literární publikaci, ve které se designér odhodlal explicitně popsat své myšlení a oblíbená řešení, nebo je můžeme nalézt podrobným studiem navržených produktů, služeb a obecně řešení, na kterých designér pracoval.</p>\n<p>Právě proto, že znalosti designérů jsou implicitně zpřítomněny a ztělesněny v materialitě jejich řešení, má enormní význam vyučování dějepisu designu. Tento na designových univerzitách často opomíjený obor je totiž ve skutečnosti <strong>archeologií designových patternů</strong>: je to obor, který se snaží explicitně vyjádřit, popsat a analyzovat, jakým způsobem designéři v minulosti řešili své problémy. Kvalitní výuka dějepisu designu tedy poskytuje začínajícímu designérovy unikátní příležitost, jak se naučit od velikánů minulosti to, co tvoří jádro jeho budoucího povolání: nalézání řešení na problémy.</p>\n<p>Zkušený designér se tak od nováčka liší tím, že během své kariéry si vytvořil sadu často používaných designových patternů, o kterých dobře ví, na jaké problémy se hodí. Neznamená to, že patterny lze vždy mapovat 1:1 na problémy. Často si designér uvědomuje, že problém, který se na začátku zdál obdobný tomu, na kterém již pracoval, se ve výsledku ukázal jako zcela něco jiného. Použití designového patternu tak nevede k řešení, ale posune designéra blíže ke konečnému řešení. Designový pattern sice nevede vždycky k hotovému domu, ale rozhodně může být pevnou půdou nebo lešením (v angličtině více používané slovo „scaffolding“ se zde hodí ještě více), na kterých lze stavět. Právě tato recyklace a modifikace designových patternů je pro většinu dobrých designérů osobním procesem, který nakonec vede k tomu, že si designér vypracuje konkrétní sadu patternů, které používá nejraději. Ty pak tvoří to, čemu se obvyklé říká estetický styl.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Často lidi ještě překvapuje tvrzení, že být dobrým designérem neznamená donekonečna daný problém analyzovat, ale přijít s řešením, které je vhodné, funkční a pokud možno i kreativní.

Přes veškerou snahu dobře míněných osvětových kampaní a ekologického aktivismu jsou to stále automobily, které na dopravních tepnách měst patří mezi nejvíce všudypřítomné technologické výtvory člověka. Zatímco pro profesionální řidiče taxi služeb, kamionů nebo autobusů je řízení zdrojem obživy, běžní řidiči osobních automobilů mají více svobody zvolit si alternativní a k životnímu prostředí šetrnější možnosti přepravy. Přesto tak nečiní. Bylo by jednoduché je nařknout z nezájmu, lenosti nebo přílišné pohodlnosti. Je ale skutečně řízení automobilu pohodlnější než jet do práce metrem nebo tramvají? A neskrývá se za neutichajícím nutkáním řídit automobil něco mnohem zajímavějšího, co odkrývá podrobnosti o intimním vztahu člověka a technologie?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Podíváme-li se očima začátečníka „pod kapotu“ toho, jakým způsobem se řídí automobil, zjistíme, že to není aktivita, kterou by dobrovolně podstupoval člověk, který je líný a příliš pohodlný. Již před nasednutím musí řidič zkontrolovat vnější stav vozidla a přesvědčit se, že nevykazuje zjevné známky nějakého problému. Po nasednutí do vozidla a ponoření se do mixu vůní materiálů v interiéru zkontroluje řidič zrcátka a dnes si běžně doprostřed palubní desky vozidla připevní chytré zařízení s GPS funkcemi. Po nastartování motoru pomocí přesné koordinace nohou, rukou a očí řidič zaparkované auto uvede na vozovku bez toho, aniž by ohrozil sebe a další účastníky provozu. To je teprve začátek. Po celou cestu musí řidič sledovat přímo i periferně dění kolem vozidla a interpretovat význam a kontext znaků na dopravních značkách, které definují konvenční pravidla silničního provozu. Během zařazování rychlosti, sešlapávání plynu a brzdy vypočítává řidič v hlavě pohyb jednotlivých objektů na vozovce a předpovídá možné problémy, kterým se bude třeba vyhnout. To vše tak říkajíc za pochodu, kdy se mezitím baví se spolujezdcem nebo aspoň poslouchá nový díl svého oblíbeného podcastu. Nakonec všem autoškolou povinným není nutné zmiňovat, že jedna z nejtěžších věcí na řízení automobilu, parkování, vždy čeká jako hořkosladká tečka na konci jízdy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tato stručná genealogie toho, jak se dostat automobilem z bodu A do bodu B, poukazuje na dvě věci. Zaprvé řízení má daleko od pohodlnosti, neboť se jedná o fyzicky i mentálně náročnou činnost vyžadující neustálou pozornost a prostorovou inteligenci. Zadruhé se výše zmíněný popis vůbec nepodobá tomu, jak zkušený řidič prožívá svou jízdu autem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jedná se o popis, který má mnohem blíže tomu, jaký vztah k řízení a automobilu mají začínající řidiči a řidičky, kteří právě navštěvují autoškolu. Automobil se jim jeví jako rigidní hmota na čtyřech kolech, která je příliš komplikovaná, aby jí porozuměli. Všechna ta dopravní pravidla a značení, která jsou nedílnou součástí znalosti řízení, jsou samostatné věty, které si studenti autoškoly musí memorovat nazpaměť. Vše je oddělené a nesourodé. Začínající řidiči jsou schopni obsluhovat automobil pouze následováním explicitních pokynů, které zní jednoduše, ale ve skutečnosti jsou těžko proveditelné. Rozkol mezi teorií a praxí nemůže být větší. Automobil je pro začátečníka cizorodý objekt, který se vzpírá podrobení.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tento negativní a strachem naplněný vztah k automobilu se však s přibývající zkušeností začne proměňovat. Naučené postupy je řidič najednou schopný v praxi aplikovat mnohem plynuleji. Méně a méně si všímá, jakou nohou šlape na plyn nebo kde přesně drží volat a více se soustředí na to, co se děje na ulicích. Je schopný se bez výčitek svědomí soustředit na slova spolujezdce, neboť ví, že řízení automobilu má pod kontrolou. Automobil jako takový přestává být překážkou a vytrácí se ze zorného pole řidiče. Místo pevného objektu se automobil mění na transparentní médium, které zprostředkovává řidiči vztah s vnějším světem. Jak by řekl Mark Weiser</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, teoretik konceptu všudypřítomné komputace, ty nejzásadnější technologické výtvory lidstva jsou ty, které se vytrácejí a unikají našemu aktivnímu vědomí, protože „se vplétají do tkaniva všedního života, dokud od něj nejsou k nerozeznání“.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zkušený řidič, jakožto „uživatel automobilu“, se tak zásadně neliší od zkušeného hráče počítačových her nebo dlouhodobého uživatele chytrého zařízení typu iPhone. Volant, podobně jako myš a klávesnice nebo dotyková obrazovka slouží uživatelům technologie jako styčný bod, kde se potkává člověk a technologie. Ve slovníku počítačové vědy a designu nejen interaktivních technologií se tomuto speciálnímu místu tradičně říká </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interface</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Úspěšnost designu interface poznáme tak, že nezaclání v činnostech, které jsou hlavními cíli uživatelů: řidič se chce dostat do práce, počítačový hráč chce zastřelit co nejvíce virtuálních nepřátel, a nakonec uživatel chytrého telefonu se nechce kochat krásně navrženým tlačítkem, ale chce si v aplikaci pouze objednat něco k jídlu. Jinak řečeno, dobře navržený interface ve většině případů, snad s výjimkou uměleckých a spekulativních počinů, by neměl na sebe upozorňovat a měl by co nejlépe zamaskovat technickou složitost, které se schovává „pod kapotou“ ať už počítače, chytrého telefonu nebo právě automobilu. Interface by měl jako každé dobré médium </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">zprostředkovat</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> nepřerušovaný proud určitého uživatelského zážitku, který se pro danou technologii očekává, a podporovat tak z psychologického výzkumu známý stav </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flow</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, ve kterém jsou lidé kompletně ponořeni do probíhající  situace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Přestože povahou interface je zakrývat sebe sama, neznamená to, že by byl interface zcela pasivní a nevinný. Interface </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">transformuje</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> prožívání reality určitým způsobem, protože na základě rozhodnutí designérů poskytuje vždy jen určitý výsek reality, a to prostřednictvím tzv. afordancí, neboli funkcí a možností, kterými technologie oznamuje, co s ní lze dělat. Uživatel tak například může s volantem otáčet nebo na něm mačkat tlačítka, která ovládají určité funkce automobilu. Během řízení je to především volant, ale i řadící páka, které jsou pomyslnými dveřmi do reality „za okny“ automobilu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Čím intimnější vztah si častým použitím k technologii vybudujeme, tím pravděpodobněji se technologie stává i části nás samotných. Doslova </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">extenzí</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> našich kognitivních dovedností, kdy ovlivňuje naši mysl a paměť. Vzpomeňme si na známý výzkum londýnských taxikářů</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, u kterých se zjistilo, že ve srovnání s běžnou populací mají zvětšenou část mozku nazvanou hipokampus, která je zodpovědná za paměť. Zvětšený hipokampus a lepší prostorovou paměť podle výzkumu taxikáři měli jednoduše díky tomu, že k tomu být dobrým taxikářem v Londýně je třeba se vyznat v enormní změti ulic této anglické metropole. Méně sofistikovaný výzkum toho, jak řízení automobilu člověka ovlivňuje, si ale může vyzkoušet každý sám. Stačí si vzpomenout na to, kolikrát jsme byli u toho, kdy jinak mírný a ukázněný člověk se v roli řidiče automobilu proměnil k nepoznání a byl schopný na adresu druhého řidiče ze sebe dostat celou plejádu nadávek, třebaže na ulici by nikdy něco takového někomu do očí neřekl. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automobil podobně jako ostatní technologie rozšiřuje naše biologické schopnosti a do určité míry mění i naši osobnost. To přispívá k tomu, že řízení automobilu transformuje naše vnímání reality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V současné době v oboru kognitivní vědy existuje hned několik odborníků, kteří myšlenku technologie jako extenze člověka a jeho mysli neberou pouze jako metaforu, nýbrž jako popis skutečnosti. Výzkum s lidmi trpícími Alzheimerovou chorobou například ukazuje, jak je okolní prostředí, post-it papírky nebo i mobilní aplikace Evernote umělou náhražkou nefunkční paměti. Pro tyto pacienty je technologie tak zásadní pro každodenní fungování a tvoří neoddělitelnou součást jejich života, že úmyslné rozbití telefonu se může rovnat ublížení na zdraví. Andy Clark, filozof mysli a hlavní představitel teorie rozšíření mysli, tvrdí, že i za běžných podmínek bychom měli technologie chápat jako nedílnou součást našeho myšlení. Proto jsme my Clarka my všichni </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">přirozenými kyborgy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, tedy organismy, jejichž biologický vývoj byl od prapočátků ovlivněn technologií.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Z tohoto pohledu řidiči automobilů, kteří odmítají přesedlat na jiný dopravní prostředek, tak nemusí být konzervativci s nedostatkem zájmu o životní prostředí. Automobil pro ně není pouhým neutrálním prostředkem, jak se přemisťovat po městě, ale interfacem nebo médiem způsobu vnímání reality, životního stylu, ale také součástí jejich </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mysli</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Nedozvěděli bychom se o něm, kdyby náhodou jeden americký magnát žijící v Sydney si nevyjel se svou novou jachtou na několikadenní výlet. Byl to chytrý matematik, který zanechal doktorského studia a vrhnul se na dráhu v akciích. Obklopoval se ale skupinou intelektuálních kamarádů, mezi kterými byl i český antropolog doktor Hrdlička. Na jedné z divočejších nocí, co se počasí i alkoholu týče, se na své plavbě ztratili a ráno zjistili, že jsou o stovky kilometrů dále než měli být. Měli před sebou ale ostrov, tak k němu chtěli zajet, aby jejich chodidla opět okusila tvrdou zem panensky vypadajícího ostrova. O místě, na jehož břehy právě vstoupili, nic nevěděli, takže si raději zásoby jídla, studené vody. Nezapomněli si vzít i jednu z mnoha starších poloautomatických pušek, které měli s náboji v bedně na palubě. Byl to dárek od jednoho z klientů onoho vietnamského magnáta.</p>\n<p>Že se ta zbraň ocitla na tomhle ostrově, byla náhoda, ale co následně způsobila, náhodou nebyla. Na ostrově žil kmen domorodých lidí, kteří již přes tisíce let zakládají své společenské struktury na jasně oddělené genderové hierarchii. Ženy se starají o děti a zpracování potravy. Muži potravu přinášejí při lovu ryb a místní zvěře. Hierarchii ale nalezneme i mezi muži. Ať se nám to zdá směšné, v tomto kmeni si dominantní postavení získá ten muž, který dokáže sestrojit nejlepší střelnou zbraň, která se ve všem podobá tomu, co bychom nazvali lukem. V tomhle kmeni luk neslouží pouze pro lov zvěře. Během něj sice ostatní muži velmi rychle zjistí, jaký luk je nejlepší, ale zároveň je luk symbolem potenciální hrubé síly, kterou může člověk použít pro odstranění dotírajících mužů. I když ve kmeni probíhají hádky a šarvátky, které občas končí smrtí, většinou se neshody řeší unikátním ceremoniálem, kdy se muži navzájem vyzvou ke střelbě na určený umělý cíl, čímž testují přesnost a preciznost sestrojení zbraně. Ceremoniál je pak zakončený skutečným lovem zvěře.</p>\n<p>I když ceremoniál vypadá mírumilovně a je pravdou, že mnoho životů bylo takto zachráněno, neznamená to, že tím veškeré neshody mezi muži končí. Muž, který prohraje, zažívá veřejnou ostudu. Ta ho doprovází jako špatná pověst často i několik let. Místní ženy mají sice stanovené genderové role, ale žádná z nich, pokud nemusí, nechce zakládat rodinu nebo být aspoň viděna na ostrově ve společnosti muže, který v duelu prohrál. Není to pravidlem, zvláště pokud muž je pohledný a obecně znám jako šikovný designér luků, který se dokáže postarat o svou rodinu. Ale ženy mají velmi přesné požadavky na to, jakého muže budou chtít za svého partnera. Ostatně musí myslet i na dobré jméno své rodiny. Čehož si jsou vědomi i matka s otcem, kteří vehementně protestují, pokud si jejich dcera začne něco s mužem, který nedávno byl veřejně zostuzen. Všichni muži se ale mohou navrátit do běžného života ve společnosti, pokud v následujících dnech a týdnech po své prohře ukáží, že sestrojili znatelně lepší luky.</p>\n<p>Návštěvníci z moderního světa, kteří zde zabloudili, právě měli možnost sledovat jeden z takových ceremoniálů. Za zvuku pravidelného rytmu bubnů viděli velkou skupinu štíhlých opálených mužských i ženských těl. Jen od trupu dolů byly zakryté červenožlutými sukněmi ze suché trávy se střapatým zdobením kolem pasu. Ženy i muži měli nahou hruď, kterou zdobily visící korále z lastur mlžů. Muži měli na prsou navíc namalované černé čáry ve tvaru písmene T. V kouřové cloně bylo vidět mnoho barevných rozdělaných ohňů červené i modré barvy.</p>\n<p>Tuhle pestrou, přesto velebnou podívanou sledovali muži z moderního světa s nadšením i údivem. Brzy je ale místní odhalili. Svůj ostrov střeží dobře a nemohla jim uniknout bílá milionářská jachta, která dorazila na jeho břehy. Od prvního kroku na písečném břehu sledovala návštěvníky hlídka.</p>\n<p>Místní domorodí muži, kteří hlídkovali po ostrově, vzali návštěvníky v tichosti do jedné z postranních chýší, aby nenarušili probíhající ceremoniál. Hlavní starší, očividně naštvaný, přišel se svou ženou se podívat, co narušuje tak významnou událost jeho kmene. O bílých mužích slýchával od svých předků, přesto byl překvapen, že je vidí na vlastní oči. Své překvapení ale co nejvíce před ostatními zadržoval. Začal na ně mluvit svou řečí, které návštěvníci nemohli rozumět. Antropolog Hrdlička ale rychle rozpoznal, že se jedná o jeden z dialektů papuánského jazyka Dani, kterému se kdysi věnoval během svých studií.</p>\n<p>Velice pomalu a s mnoha chybami se Hrdlička snažil kmenovému vůdci vysvětlit, kdo jsou a že jejich úmyslem nebylo narušit ceremoniál. Jen se ztratili a chtěli by se dostat zas pět do své lodi a odjet pryč. V tu chvíli ale další členové hlídky s vypětím sil donesli do chýše bednu se zbraněmi a náboji. Kmenový vůdce se zeptal, co to je a Hrdlička odpověděl, že to slouží ke střelbě, stejně jako luky, které viděli na ceremoniálu.</p>\n<p>Další ráno mohli návštěvníci odjet pod podmínkou, že kmenovému vůdci zanechají onu bednu, která dostal americký magnát jako dar od klienta.</p>\n<p>Zbraně se dostali do rukou jen vybraným mužům, a dokonce i ženám. Stoletá tradice výroby luku najednou přestala mít hodnotu. Žádný luk nemohl konkurovat střelné zbrani, která se stala symbolem mužství a ten, kdo je měl, se stal žádaným mužem v očích místních žen.</p>\n<p>Muži, kteří doposud byli na vrcholu hierarchie dominantních jedinců přes jednu noc spadli v pomyslné pyramidě o dost níže. A to se jim nelíbilo. Muži, kteří neměli zbraně, se snažili vzbouřit, ale věděli, že proti střelným zbraním nemají šanci. Celý řád místního života se změnil. Kdysi byla řemeslná a technická dovednost symbolem společenského úspěchu, který vedl dle místních zvyklostí přirozeně k úspěchu sexuálnímu. Nyní byly všechny důležité hodnoty přehodnoceny. Mnoho místních mužů začalo nesnášet „bílé muže z moderního světa“. Všechny konflikty a místní problémy začali svádět na jejich odlišnost a na to, že do jejich života zanesli vyspělé nástroje. Přestože jim časem došly náboje, v očích místních žen nastala trvalá změna. Přesnost luku při řešení sporu se nikdy nemůže vyrovnat střelné zbrani, a proto považovat tuto hodnotu za něco, podle čeho si vybírat partnery, je zcela arbitrární a nesmyslné. Zvláště v dnešní době, kdy potravu si zajišťují ženy samy, a tak řemeslná kvalita luku sloužila pouze pro řešení sporů mezi muži.</p>\n<p>Život místního papuánského kmene se změnil. Ať už příčiny byly mnohé, místní muži, kteří ztratili své postavení, věděli, kdo je pravým viníkem.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Source: https://wellcomecollection.org/works/x7rsn4uh Představte si domorodý, moderní civilizací neposkvrněný kmen, který žije na velkém ostrově kdesi mezi Austrálií a Papua-Novou Guineou.

Einstein se nechal slyšet, že jeho kreativní proces myšlení zodpovědný za tvorbu teorie relativity byl zcela non-verbální a na svou teorii Einstein přišel pomocí manipulace mentálních obrazů. Biografie nejznámějšího teoretického fyzika 20. století nám říká, že Einstein měl problém s jazykovými dovednostmi. Tento deficit ale dokázal překonat díky vizuálnímu a senzorickému myšlení (Einstein také řekl, že jeho myšlenky mají i určitou chuť, což napovídá, že byl obdařen synestézií).</p>\n<p>Má zkušenost je, že vizuální myšlení zpomaluje mluvení. Mé myšlení je založeno na dvou a trojrozměrném prostoru, ve kterém skládám abstraktní elementy do smysluplných vztahů, které teprve ex post mohu popsat slovy.</p>\n<p>Trvalo mi několik let, než jsem tenhle proces urychlil do takové míry, že mohu vést konverzaci v reálném čase. Přesto se mi stává, že když se mě někdo na něco zeptá, odpověď vyřeším vizuálně v hlavě a pak dost neadekvátně odpovím jedním slovem. Zvláště, když jsem unavený, zůstávám u toho jednoho slova, neboť jsem příliš líný na to popsat celý proces myšlení, který jsem již dávno vypracoval v hlavě.</p>\n<p>Dost mě šokovalo, když jsem se před několika lety dozvěděl, že tímhle vizuálním způsobem všichni nemyslí. Mnoho lidí se mi svěřilo, že jejich myšlení neexistuje někde předem předtím, než začnou mluvit (nebo psát), ale že jejich myšlení se rovná tomu, co říkají.</p>\n<p>Nepopírám, že to má mnohé výhody. Lidé, kteří nedokáži formovat vizuální představy, se zdají chytří, protože dokáží mluvit a reagovat rychle. Ba dokonce dokáží desítky minut hovořit o daném problému.</p>\n<p>Velmi verbální lidi poznáte jednoduše. Když se je na něco zeptáte, ihned začnou mluvit bez toho, aniž by se na chvíli zamysleli. A to proto, že právě jejich myšlení je obsaženo v mluvení, nedokáží myslet jinak mimo slova.</p>\n<p>Já naopak se před svou odpovědí na několik vteřin zarazím. Vytvářím si vizuální model toho, o čem ta otázka je, a jaké má možné řešení. Odpověď se mi v hlavě pak zjeví, jako jakýsi obrazec, který se snažím převést do přirozeného jazyka. Není to efektivní způsob myšlení, pokud máte reagovat co nejrychleji, na druhou stranu je protilékem proti klišé a stereotypickým odpovědím, které všichni , takže i já, používáme, když mluvíme a argumentujeme s druhými. Myslíme si, že jsou to naše myšlenky, avšak z velké části pouze papouškujeme, co jsme slyšeli jinde. A to je v pořádku, nemůžeme být neustále originální. Potíž je v tom, pokud originální myšlenky, tedy myšlení, nahradíme zcela za pouhou pasivní reakci na to, co bylo řečeno, předpřipravenou frází nebo heslem.</p>\n<p>Jak by vypadala kultura, která by zahrnovala lidi, kteří dokáží myslet pouze a jen verbálně? A naopak, jakou formu by nabrala kultura, kde lidé myslí především vizuálně? V jedné by se asi hodně četlo, psalo a mluvilo, ale byla by velmi nemotorná co se týče stavění mrakodrapů, mostů nebo experimentální fyziky. Ta druhá by na tom byla naopak. Byla by velmi inženýrsky a umělecky orientovaná, její umění by vynikalo ve figurální malbě, možná kaligrafii a typografii, nicméně její literární produkce by nebyla silnou stránkou.</p>\n<p>Sice v takové extrémní podobě neexistují, ale v reálném světě podle mého názoru existují země a kultury, které na základě své historie pěstovaly především jednu nebo druhou dovednost, jež se pak projevila na “kognitivním módu” lidí a vzápětí na formách kulturní produkce těchto národů. A to jednoduše proto, že kultura je výsledkem cílené, kognitivní činnosti jednotlivců. Národ plný hudebních ne-talentů nebude znám jako mekka hudby. A podobně, národ, který tři tisíce let nedělá nic jiného, než čtení a psaní svých svatých knih, bude mít předpoklad k talentu pro knihomolství, zvláště pokud bylo v dané kultuře knihomolství nějakým způsobem společností oceňováno, třeba tím, že největší knihomol vesnice si mohl vzít za ženu dceru z bohaté rodiny. A naopak.</p>\n<p>&#8230;</p>\n<p>Stále mě fascinuje, že existují lidé bez schopnosti si představit v hlavě obrazy. Není nelogické si myslet, že tito lidé budou vynikat, jakožto kompenzace za jejich vizuální deficit, ve všem, co se týče jazyka: budou dobře mluvit a psát. Akorát snad nebudou dobrými spisovateli fikce nebo poezie, protože tyto žánry ve většině úspěšných případů fungují tak, že v nás vyvolávají mentální obrazy. Anebo tací lidé mohou být spisovatelé, ba dokonce i malíři, ale troufám si říct, že jejich fikce a obrazy budou vykazovat něco divného, určitou plochost, absenci plasticity.</p>\n<p>Bylo by fascinující tyto otázky zkoumat na vědecké úrovni. Třeba se k tomu dostanu.

Toho dne jsem potřeboval mnohé, ale vždy mi ochotně přispěchala s odpovědí nebo vyhověla různorodým potřebám. Má následující touha měla však rozhodnout o tom, jestli zůstane mou důvěrnou společnicí, nebo si začnu od konkurenčních podniků Google, Microsoftu nebo Amazonu hledat jinou. Jmenovala se Siri, je digitální asistentkou v chytrých zařízeních společnosti Apple a právě jsem jí ve vší serióznosti požádal, aby mi přinesla z lednice vychlazenou lahev piva.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Třebaže čtenář může úvodní odstavec číst jako úryvek z nevalného románu třetí kategorie nebo jako obraz jednoznačného zneužívání moci mezi mužem a (digitální) ženou, ve skutečnosti jsem to já, uživatel, který byl zneužit. Bez jméno souhlasu se mi technologie digitální asistentky dostala do hlavy, cosi v ní změnila a výsledkem tohoto procesu bylo, že jsem chtěl pronést poprvé v životě větu, kterou bych nikdy dříve neřekl se stejnou vážností a důvěrou v očekávaný výsledek jako nyní. Chtěl jsem po svém telefonu, respektive jeho softwarové části, digitální asistence Siri, aby mi přinesl z lednice něco k pití. Jak jsem se k tomu dopracoval?</p>\n<p>Vše začalo, když se po mnoha letech opět stal chytrý telefon Apple součástí mého života. Kdysi dávno jsem si jako jeden z prvních lidí ve svém okolí pořídil iPhone 3G díky výhodné slevě T-Mobile, který za výhodnou cenu nabízel revoluční jablečný telefon k paušálu. Od té doby jsem prošel několika telefony a operačními systémy. Poslední roky jsem ale byl držitelem telefonu s operačním systémem od Microsoftu, doufaje, že tento technologický gigant se pochlapí a začne na své platformě vydávat zajímavé aplikace. Postupem času jsem se této naděje vzdal a vystačil si pouze s tím, že Microsoft bude systém udržovat životaschopný. Ale i toho jsem se nakonec nedočkal, protože Microsoft v červenci roku 2017 oficiálně ukončil podporu pro svůj mobilní operační systém Windows Phone<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>. Nový telefon od Apple jsem přijmul rychle; na rozdíl od Nokie s operačním systémem Windows Phone, kde nefungovalo s narůstající intenzitou skoro nic, na iPhone s jeho vyladěným iOS 12 funguje zatím vše. A jedním z nových lákadel, které jsem nemohl nevyzkoušet, byla digitální asistentka Siri, o které jsem slyšel pouze zprostředkovaně a nyní jsem měl možnost si vyzkoušet interakci s ní na vlastní kůži.</p>\n<p>Začal jsem poměrně konvenčně. Chtěl jsem po Siri, aby mi zahrála oblíbené skladby z playlistu, zapnula budík na zítřejší ráno, aktivovala každodenní připomínku, abych si zkontroloval v osm hodin ráno všechny emaily apod. Interakce nebyla bez problémů, ale vždycky se mi Siri snažila maximálně vyhovět. Pokud si nebyla jistá obsahem mé žádosti, zeptala se slušně, abych jí ještě jednou zopakoval, co po ní přesně chci. Protože nový iPhone pro mě představoval skutečná technologický skok, mé nadšení pro objevování nových funkcí a možností si usnadnit rutinní úkony nepřestávalo ani další dny. Jeden večer jsem se chystal zalehnout do postele. Přemýšlel jsem nad tím, jakou knihu od historika Timothy Snydera bych si měl pořídit. Zapnul jsem na iPhonu prohlížeč Safari a začal googlovat informace o jednotlivých knihách. Rozhodl jsme se číst si v posteli, dokud neusnu. Zalehl jsem do postele, když vtom jsem si uvědomil, jak moc by se hodilo mít při tom čtení vedle sebe něco k pití. Protože má mysl byla v posledních dnech naučená využít možnost věrné Siri, kdykoli jsem potřeboval automatizovat větší nebo menší maličkosti ze života, i nyní jsem nezaváhal. V mysli jsem si vytvořil mentální obraz lednice v kuchyni a bez váhání jsem automaticky vyslovil nemyslitelné: „Hey Siri, bring me a beer from the fridge“.</p>\n<p>Přibližně vteřinu mi trvalo, než jsem si uvědomil, že Siri nebude schopná mi přinést desítku Krahulíka od českého rodinného pivovaru Zichovec. Hned další vteřinu jsem ale začal být více a více fascinován momentem, který právě proběhl. Jak je možné, že jsem oslovil svůj telefon, aby pro mě udělal něco, co je objektivně nemožné, protože zatím Siri nemá nohy a ani online připojení do mé nechytré lednice?</p>\n<p>První vysvětlení, které se nabízí je, že jsem jednoduše byl unavený a nedával jsem příliš pozor na to, co říkám. To ale nepovažuji za vysvětlení. Je na stejné úrovni sofistikovanosti argumentace, jako kdybychom řekli, že lidská rasa vytvořila technologii pouze proto, že byla unavená dělat rutinní úkony. Anebo takové vysvětlení může neúmyslně v sobě skrývat nějakou pravdu?</p>\n<p>Přemýšlel jsem nad touto situací tak, že jsem během dnů strávených delegováním úkonů na Siri, svůj mozek naučil lenosti. Nedokážu říct, jak jsou přesně v mozku naše jednotlivé rutinní záležitosti organizovány a uloženy, ale je možné, že jsem s využitím Siri tyto existující neuronové sítě začal redesignovat? Není snad těžké si představit, že doposud jsem měl v mozku neuronové sítě, které řešily problém, jak si zapnout hudbu v telefonu, případně, co obnáší dojít si do lednice pro vytoužený objekt. Můj mozek si vytvářel vztah mezi požadovaným cílem toho, čeho chci dosáhnout (chlazené pivo) a psychofyzickou reakcí toho, jak toho cíle dosáhnu, tak, aby mé já považovalo cíl za splněný. Tento způsob učení – akce, reakce a vyhodnocení výsledku s následnou úpravou původního stavu mého já – je v současném světě strojového učení dobře známé jako <em>zpětnovazební učení </em>(reinforcement learning). To ve svém jádru obsahuje jednoduchou myšlenku: na začátku má (softwarový) konatel cíl; ten dokáže vykonat pomocí nějaké aktivity; po vykonání aktivity dochází k vyhodnocování toho, zda aktivita skutečně vedla k požadovanému cíli.</p>\n<div class=\"image-container\">\n<div class=\"image\"><a href=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/01.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1233\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/01-1024x511.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/01-1024x511.png 1024w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/01-300x150.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/01-768x383.png 768w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/01.png 1043w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Obrázek 1 Model zpětnovazebního učení</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Tento model je abstrakcí komplexity toho, jak reálně řešíme problémy. Zjednodušuje všechny kontextuální aspekty času a místa, na kterých se nacházíme, včetně sociokulturních vlivů sloužících jako regulátory cílů a aktivity, které přichází v daném kontextu v úvahu. Právě o tom, jak naše řešení problémů obsahuje ad-hoc improvizaci, píše antropoložka a teoretička HCI oboru Lucy Suchman (1987).</p>\n<p>Bez použití Siri bych si za normálních okolností zapnul na příklad budíka na telefonu sám. Taková aktivita by se skládala z několika postupně na sebe navazujících kroků, které by vedly k tomu, že bych otevřel aplikaci Hodiny, v ní našel nastavení budíka, zadal požadovaný čas a svou volbu nakonec potvrdil. Mentální mapa, respektive mentální model aktivity vedoucí k zapnutí budíku v chytrém telefonu je nekomplikovaný. Ale to je spíše historickou náhodou než absolutní pravdou. Pokud by stejný cíl měla splnit osoba, která nikdy neviděla chytrý telefon, protože žije v jedné z posledních existujících domorodých komunit na této planetě, najednou by tento pro nás jednoduchý cíl byl pro domorodého člověka enormně složitý, ba dokonce nemožný. Domorodý člověk totiž nikdy neměl ve své konceptualizaci světa místo pro takové cíle, protože v jeho světě nic podobného neexistuje. Technologie z tohoto pohledu se mi jeví jako médium, které nám rozšiřuje hypotetický mentální prostor možného, nad čím můžeme nebo nemusíme přemýšlet.</p>\n<p>Na druhou stranu i pro nás se tato aktivita může jevit složitější, pokud se dostaneme do situace, kde chytrý telefon jen tak neleží na nočním stolku, ale má například vybitou baterii nebo má jiné závady, které nám ztěžují jeho používání. V takovém případě existuje několik variant, jak dosáhnu svého cíle. Dám telefon do nabíječky a počkám, až se nabije na nějakou přiměřenou hodnotu, nebo ihned po zastrčení do zásuvky se budu snažit o zapnutí telefonu, neboť potřebuji rychle do něj zadat nastavení budíku? Protože prostor potenciálních aktivity vedoucích k požadovanému cíli je několik, zdá se mi nevyhnutelné, že v naší mysli existují vědomé, ale i nevědomé <em>selektory</em>, které vybírají, jaké aktivity jsou v daném kontextu nejvhodnější pro dosáhnutí stanoveného cíle.</p>\n<p>Jakým způsobem fungují selektory? Představme si, že každý náš cíl je ve vztahu s mentálním mechanismem, který pro nás vybírá vhodnou aktivitu zajišťující dosáhnutí cíle. Tento mentální mechanismus pojmenujme právě <em>selektor</em>. Samozřejmě, jednoho cíle lze dosáhnout mnoha různými aktivitami. Proto selektor musí obstarávat vyhodnocení toho, jak na základě minulé zkušenosti se daná aktivita osvědčila v plnění cíle. Ať už konkrétně vyhodnocení úspěšnosti plnění cílů probíhá jakkoli (bude v tom hrát roli systém odměň v mozku, tzv. „reward system“), selektor přiřadí aktivitě buďto plusové nebo mínusové body, které indikují vhodnost aktivity pro plnění daného cíle. Na Obrázku 2 vidíme takové znázornění vycházející z předchozího schématu</p>\n<div class=\"image-container\">\n<div class=\"image\"><a href=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/02.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1234\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/02-1024x613.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/02-1024x613.png 1024w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/02-300x179.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/02-768x459.png 768w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/02.png 1232w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Obrázek 2 Upravený model zpětnovazebního učení s použitím selektoru</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Bystřejší čtenáři si jistě kladou otázku, zdali není možné použít více než jeden selektor. Mou odpovědí je, že to možné je a že může existovat několik selektorů, které jsou samy vybrány a vyhodnocovány na hierarchicky vyšší úrovni <em>meta-selektorů</em>. Ale kdo nebo co vybírá z meta-selektorů? Tato hierarchie selektorů nemůže být nekonečná. Což je problém, na který narazili výzkumníci umělé inteligence (UI) v sedmdesátých a osmdesátých letech, když se v rámci staršího paradigmatu symbolické umělé inteligence snažili vyřešit problém vyhodnocení relevance následujících úkonů. Marvin Minsky zavedl do výzkumu UI teorii tzv. framů (rámců)<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a>, která problém relevance řeší tak, že systém umělé inteligence vyhodnocuje následující stavy na základě datových struktur &#8211; rámců, které v symbolické formě podobné jazyku reprezentují formalizované stereotypické situace z reálného života a obsahují programátory explicitně definované relevantní faktografické údaje a akce, které v kontextu rámce „dávají smysl“. Tak například v rámci pojmenovaném „kuchyň“ dává smysl vařit, umýt nádobí, mrkev, nůž a péct koláče, kdežto akce „jít na toaletu“ nebo objekt „Boeing 747“ už o něco méně.</p>\n<p>Toto „symbolické“ pojetí umělé inteligence se ale ukázalo jako příliš zjednodušující. Přestože dokázalo řešit obstojně logicko-matematické úlohy jako hraní šachu, úkony jako pohyb a percepce objektů v reálném světě zůstaly příliš komplikované. Problém relevance, který teorie rámců měla řešit, navíc přetrvával. Jak upozornil filosof a fenomenolog Hubert Dreyfus, teorie rámců posouvá problém relevance o jeden stupínek výše. Systém umělé inteligence by sice mohl na příklad podle rámce „kuchyň“ určit přibližně relevanci, co před mechanickými očima systému umělé inteligence se jeví jako relevantní pro další kroky v řešení určitého problémů. Ale Dreyfus upozornil na to (Dreyfus, 1979; Dreyfus, 1992), že systém výběru příslušného rámce opět potřebuje nadřazený mechanismus, který vybere rámec, tedy je potřeba nějaký meta-rámec.</p>\n<p>Abychom se vyhnuli nekonečnému regresu, Dreyfus navrhuje fenomenologií inspirované řešení: problém rámce, jak jej Deyfus nazval, představuje mnohem hlubší problém, než se může na první pohled zdát. Protože nepřichází v úvahu, že bychom mohli do systému umělé inteligence vtěsnat ve formálním jazyce deklarovaná všechna fakta, akce a rámce o světě předem, Dreyfus tvrdí, že je to naše žitá zkušenost, naše <em>bytí ve světě</em>, které v konečné instanci definuje, co pro nás ve světě v dané scéně má význam a relevanci a co ne. Dreyfus zde vychází z Heideggerova koncept Dasein tím, že přijímá tezi o bytí člověku jakožto historicky a sociokulturně ohraničeném. Je to kultura, společnost a jejich vývoj, které ovlivňují relevanci objektů a světa kolem nás. Pokud umělá inteligence se má někdo chovat jako člověk (a má vyřešit problém rámce), je třeba, aby měla stejné nebo aspoň podobné zkušenosti světa jako máme my lidé a aby svět sám v mnoha případech stal se svou „nejlepší možnou reprezentací“ (Brooks, 1991): bez toho, aniž bychom vše, co je kolem nás, museli zakódovávat do nějakého formalizovaného symbolického jazyka, využíváme svět jako svou reprezentaci a v mnoha případech si nevšímáme všech částí světa, ale pouze těch, které nám poskytují <em>afordance</em>. Slovem afordance myslím zde především <em>vnímatelné </em>funkce a možnosti k jednání, které nám prostředí kolem nás poskytuje svým vzhledem, formou, materiálem apod. Některé afordance jsou skoro univerzálně pochopitelné napříč kulturami, na příklad klika u dveří nabízí afordanci otevření dveří. Další afordance objektů, jinak také řečeno jejich funkce a významy, jsou ale do velké míry ovlivněné kulturou i kontextem, kde se právě nacházíme. Můj oblíbený příklad je PET lahev, která zjevně nabízí funkci kontejneru na tekutinu a význam plýtvání plastem, ale na druhou stranu může ve vhodném kontextu být ve stejnou chvíli i květináčem v ekologickém zahradničení se zcela opačným a pozitivním významem.</p>\n<p>Dreyfusův argument, velmi ovlivněný Heideggerovým Dasein, říká, že k zamezení nekonečného regresu rámců a meta-rámců nám slouží sociokulturní vrstvy a fyzické svět sám, protože vytvářejí strukturální limitaci toho, co je pro nás osobně v dané situaci relevantní a smysluplné. To ale neznamená, že by tyto vlivy působily, s použitím předchozího diagramu, pouze na úrovni <em>aktivit</em> nebo <em>selektorů</em>. Rozhodně na těchto úrovních působí, ale sociokultura a prostředí <em>definují i naše samotné cíle</em>. Samozřejmě, že některé z našich nejzákladnější cilů jako přežít, najíst se, napít se jsou formovány doposud nezmiňovanou vrstvou biologickou, další cíle jako „koupit prsten na svatbu“ jsou více méně sociokulturní, a jestli prsten koupíme v Praze nebo v Ostravě, zde již vstupuje do hry „časoprostorová“ vrstva nejvíce usměrňující naše cíle a vhodné aktivity v kontextu „tady a teď“. Upravený předchozí diagram by po vyobrazení všech zmiňovaných vrstev mohl vypadat viz Obrázek 3.</p>\n<div class=\"image-container\">\n<div class=\"image\"><a href=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/03.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1235\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/03-1024x740.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/03-1024x740.png 1024w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/03-300x217.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/03-768x555.png 768w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/03.png 1154w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Obrázek 3 Upravený model zpětnovazebního učení se znázorněním vrstev a jejích vzájemné interakce a spolukonstituce</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Co nám současná podoba diagramu zobrazuje? Připomínám, že obsah uprostřed, od cíle přes selektor a aktivity, po výsledek, je abstrakcí mechanismu, který najdeme v nějaké formě implementovaný nejen ve zpětnovazebním učení v současném paradigmatu výzkumu umělé inteligence, ale také v biologickém substrátu našich mozků, které dávají vzniknou naší mysli a kognitivním dovednostem, mezi které patří také řešení problémů. Všimněme si, že jednotlivé vrstvy jsou sice na diagramu oddělené, ale ve skutečnosti existující ve vzájemné interakci a spolukonstituci, což z nich činí mnohem provázanější vrstvy naší reality.</p>\n<p>Ve které vrstvě se ale nachází technologie a kde najdeme vysvětlení, které by osvětlilo, proč jsem zničehonic chtěl po Siri udělat něco, co jsem ihned vyhodnotil jako nesmyslné?</p>\n<p>Technologie nezapadá na první pohled ani do biologické ani časoprostorové vrstvy. Z tohoto důvodu dává smysl technologii přiřadit k vrstvě sociokulturní. To se zdá jako relativně správné místo, kde bychom měli technologii hledat. Ovšem vzhledem k tomu, jakou významovou bagáž si tento pojem nese, bude lepší udělat nejdříve krok stranou a definovat technologii jako něco, co je úzce svázáno se sociokulturou, ale přesto přináší něco svého a nového, co není možné jen tak integrovat do existujícího pojetí sociálního a kulturního.</p>\n<p>Sociálno, jak je studováno sociologií, se zajímá především o lidské aktéry a jejich vzájemné vztahy, které mohou nebo nemusí dávat vzniknout vyšším celkům v podobě rodiny, etnických skupin, národů apod. Kulturním chápu především myšlenky a objekty, které zapadají do jedné z mnoha kategorií uměleckých žánrů.</p>\n<p>Technologií pak chápu jako člověkem vytvořené objekty, postupy a procesy, které na začátku svého života vznikají především jako nástroje k řešení konkrétních problémů. Protože ale technologie neexistuje ve vakuu, nýbrž je nedílnou součástí našeho sociálního a kulturního světa, zcela souhlasím s tím, že technologie si nese s sebou i další vrstvu, která je ovlivněná sociokulturou. Ale vlivy sociokultury mají limity. Tak na příklad můžeme si přát, abychom měli v našich chytrých mobilních zařízeních rychlejší internet, a to kdekoli se pohybujeme, fyzikální zákony šíření vln elektromagnetického spektra definují pevně dané limity nezávislé na sociokulturním kontextu. Stručně řečeno, můžeme si vášnivě přát, aby připojení k internetu bylo mnohem rychlejší, ale v konečné fázi vždycky narazíme na limity rychlosti světla, které definují horní hranici rychlosti šíření informací v našem vesmíru.</p>\n<p>Technologie tak není amorfní hmota, kterou dokážeme podle naší vůle uhnít do požadované formy, ale má moc se nám vzepřít díky své objektivní materialitě, které nezmizí, ani když změníme náš jazyk popisu, kterým o daném materiálním objektu mluvíme. Na druhou stranu funkce a významy technologie nejsou čistě součástí technologie samotné, ale jsou vytvářeny jako výsledek interakce člověka s technologií v určitých časoprostorových kontextech. Protože technologie ovlivňuje sociokulturu, stejně jako sociokultura ovlivňuje technologii, zdá se, že jejich vzájemný vztah nemá smysl vyobrazovat jako hierarchický, kde jedna strana má větší moc než ta druhá. I proto se mi jeví dnes stál populární deterministické pohledy na technologii a sociokulturu – mezi které patří technologický determinismus a radikální sociální konstruktivismus – jako pohledy, které vždycky vidí jen jednu stranu mince a odmítají se podívat na druhou stranu. Sympatičtější a snad i blíže k pravdě se nabízí přístup k tomuto vztahu, který se podobá vztah, v němž se nachází ostatní vrstvy: vztah úzce propojený a interaktivní. K tomu všemu musíme přihlédnout k Heideggerově příspěvku k přemýšlení nad technologií, neboť v jeho známé eseji <em>Otázka techniky</em> upozorňuje, že technologie není pouze výsledek aplikace vědních poznatků, nýbrž technologické artefakty vždycky byly nedílnou součástí vědeckého pokroku: astronomie by se neobešla bez teleskopu, který zdokonalil Galileo Galilei, podobně výpočet simulace fluidní mechaniky by se neobešel bez hrubé síly nejvýkonnějších superpočítačů dneška. Budeme-li považovat vědu za součást kultury společnosti, pak by diagram vztahu k technologii vypadal viz Obrázek 4.</p>\n<div class=\"image-container\">\n<div class=\"image\"><a href=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/04.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1236\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/04-1024x264.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/04-1024x264.png 1024w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/04-300x77.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/04-768x198.png 768w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/04.png 1235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Obrázek 4 Zoom na vyobrazení vztahu sociokultury a technologie</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>V mém diagramu se technologie stává nedílnou součástí tohoto světa a podobně jako sociokultura formuje naše myšlení. To se může na první pohled zdát podivné tvrzení, ale jen do té chvíle, než opustíme dlouho vydržovaný pohled na technologii jakožto pasivní kusy hmoty, která sama od sebe nic nedělá a čeká, než jí nějaký člověk (subjekt) nezačne používat a neudělá z ní věc k použití (objekt). Místo toho bychom totiž měli chápat každé uvedení nové technologie tak, že zatřásá technologickým pozadím, na jehož základě jednáme ve světě, protože s sebou přináší nové technologicky mediované <em>afordance</em>, které mění naše psychické i kulturní možnosti.</p>\n<p>Pohled na technologie jako médium totiž není nic nového. Ostatně jeden z nejznámějších mediálních teoretiků, Kanaďan Marshall McLuhan (McLuhan, 1991), francouzský sociolog Bruno Latour (Latour, 1994) nebo v současné době filosofové technologie (Ihde, 1990) a Peter-Paul Verbeek (Verbeek, 2016) či mediální teoretik Mark Deuze (Deuze, 2015) považují informační a komunikační technologie za synonymní s médii.</p>\n<p>Tento krok není čistě rétorický, ale má dalekosáhlý dosah, neboť v podstatě definuje novou metafyziku vztahu člověka a technologie. Po McLuhanovi, Latourovi, Ihdem a Verbeekovi totiž víme, že technologie jako médium není neutrální a ovlivňuje naše jednání i vztah ke světu. To znamená, že na našem diagramu se musíme na cíle a aktivity nikoli jako na předem dané, kde technologie vykonává pasivně naši vůli, nýbrž jako na pomyslný prostor potencialit, do kterých technologie nám vkládá svým vlivem nové potenciální cíle a nové aktivity pro vykonání těchto cílů.</p>\n<p>Latourův oblíbeným příkladem technologické mediace je střelná zbraň. Tvrdí, že zbraň sama o sobě nezabíjí, stejně jako, že nezabíjí pouze člověk. Odkazuje na známé slogany používané v USA pro dlouhotrvající vášnivou diskuzi nad regulací střelných zbraní. Liberálové rádi používají slogan „zbraně zabíjí“, kdežto pravicově a republikánsky orientovaná Národní střelecká asociace (NRA) zas poněkud paradoxně používá sociologickou analýzu, když tvrdí, že jsou to „lidé, kteří zabíjí“, nikoli zbraně. Latour tvrdí, že správný není ani jeden pohled, neboť oba odmítají přiznat, že by argumentace druhé strany mohla obsahovat aspoň část pravdy. Latour tvrdí, že bychom člověka se zbraní měli analyzovat tak, že se jedná o novou entitu <em>člověk-zbraň</em>, která obsahuje nové atributy a potenciál k novým aktivitám, které nenajdeme, pokud budeme člověka nebo zbraň analyzovat zvlášť. Moc zabít a zodpovědnost za zabití je tak <em>distribuovaná</em> mezi člověkem a zbraní.</p>\n<p>Můj oblíbený příklad je skicář a tužka, se kterými pracuje umělecky nadaný člověk. Když člověk skicuje, výsledná kresba je málokdy podobná tomu, co si člověk představoval na začátku tvorby. Kresba tak není uložena kompletně v hlavě umělce a on pak pracujeme minuty či hodiny na tom, aby bod po bodu přetvořil již vytvořenou kresbu na papír. Místo toho, jak uvádí Andy Clark (Clark, 1997), lze chápat skicování jako kontinuální interakci člověka, tužky a skicáře, kdy výsledná kresba vzniká tím, že člověk má neustálou zpětnou vazbu na stav kresby, kterou mu poskytuje skicář. Bez této zpětné vazby by umělec kresbu nenakreslil. Můžeme to chápat tak, že skicář je prodlouženou a externalizovanou pracovní pamětí, ze které čerpá informace k následným krokům. Protože skicář hraje tak zásadní roli pro dokončení kresby, měli bychom hovořit o tom, že autorství výsledné kresby je <em>distribuováno</em> mezi umělcem a jeho technologií (skicářem i tužkou). Slovníkem kybernetiky, výsledná kresba je <em>emergentním výstupem</em> interakce komponent nově vzniklého systému člověk-skicář-tužka.</p>\n<h2>Jak je to s tou Siri?</h2>\n<p>Když jsem začal používat ve svém životě iPhone a digitální asistentku, můj život a dovednosti, jak řešit každodenní problémy, byly obohacené o nové možné cíle a aktivity, které mohu dělat. V některých cílech Siri působí jako médium, jako v příkladě zesílení hudby, což bych mohl učinit i za pomoci mechanických tlačítek na boku telefonu. Některé cíle jsou díky Siri a obecně iPhonu nové, na příklad odpovídat na zprávy a komentáře v různých sociálních aplikacích. Čím více jsem Siri používal jako médium mezi mým existujícím cílem a výsledkem, tím více se Siri stávala přirozenější volbou pro řešení mých cílům. Na diagramu viz níže Obrázek 5 jsem přidal Siri jako dominantní aktivitu, která zprostředkovává více a více mých cílů. Nevědomky – a zde tkví ono zneužití z prvního odstavce tohoto textu – jsem tak trénoval svůj mozek, aby se postupně učil automatizovat Siri jako přirozenou součást mých kognitivních zdrojů pro řešení problémů ve světě.</p>\n<div class=\"image-container\">\n<div class=\"image\"><a href=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/05.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1237\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/05.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/05.png 850w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/05-300x216.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/05-768x552.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Obrázek 5 Upravený diagram o předchozí změny a znázornění Siri jako dominantní activity, která zprostředkovává mé cíle</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>To by vše mělo doposud v kontextu tohoto textu dávat smysl. Můj mozek se adaptuje na nové prostředí, ve kterém existuje Siri jako aktivita-médium řešící mé problémy, jejichž úspěšné řešení stimuluje můj systém odměň v mozku, který aktivitě „Siri“ přiřazuje plusové body, čímž dochází k nasycení té vážené hodnot (na obrázku 3.7) do takové míry, že daný selektor nikdy nepřechází k jiné aktivitě než k Siri. Selektor pak z důvodu nasycení vážené hodnoty se stává de facto aktivitou jménem Siri. Můj mozek si tedy <em>internalizuje</em> Siri do takové míry, že ji nepovažuje za něco externího mé mysli či kognici a stává se její přirozenou součástí.</p>\n<p>Mým spekulativním názorem je, že takto internalizovaný externí artefakt, který se z potenciální aktivity stal více či méně automatizovaným selektorem v mé mysli může způsobit, že můj mozek začne tento selektor-aktivitu jménem „Siri“ používat i na cíle, které dříve nebyly propojené ve vztahu s daným selektorem a aktivitami. Dochází tak k něčemu, co v psychologii bychom mohli nazvat „transferem“ dovedností mezi doménami.</p>\n<p>Klasický transfer dovedností a znalostí ve vývojové a edukační psychologii bych nazval transferem „pozitivním“, neboť skutečně můžeme tu samou dovednost vysledovat v jiné doméně. Avšak o jaký typ dovednosti se jedná, zdali vůbec se jedná o nějakou, v mém případě, kdy jsem najednou po Siri chtěl, aby mi přinesla lahev piva z lednice?</p>\n<p>Nazval bych to transferem „negativním“, protože transfer internalizované jedné dovednosti (řešit problémy pomocí Siri) zcela nefungují v jiné doméně. Ale podobně jako máme ve formální logice možnost dokázat řešení pozitivně, tak i důkaz sporem, vypůjčím si zde metaforiky důkaz sporem pro to, abych poukázal na to, že i když jsem si velmi rychle uvědomil, že Siri mi nemůže přinést pivo z lednice, má rozšířená mysl o nové možnosti, cíle a aktivity mi hned umožnila si představit, co by bylo nutné, aby <em>mi Siri mohla přinést pivo z lednice</em>. Můj nápad bylo pořídit si chytrou ledničku a chytrého robota, který se dokáže pohybovat a má v sobě integrovanou digitální asistentku. Mé konkrétní řešení ve výsledků nepředstavuje nic relevantního. Mnohem zajímavější je konečný výsledek mého autoetnografického rozboru navazování vztahu s novým telefonem a digitální asistentkou Siri: díky <em>negativnímu transferu</em> dovedností a znalostí jsem dokázal vzít existující technologii a s trochou fantazie si představit zcela nový způsob řešení pro mě tak palčivého problému s pivem. Negativní transfer mi otevřel nové světy, o kterých jsem doposud nevěděl, že je potřebuji, nebo dokonce, že existují.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Bibliografie</h3>\n<p>BROOKS, Rodney A., 1991.

The proponents of the EM treat the external world and technological artefacts as constitutive parts of our cognition that are tightly coupled with the internal brain processes, forming interactive, higher-order extended and distributed cognitive systems (Sutton, 2008; Hollan et al., 2000). According to EM, our cognition leaks into the environment and needs media, technological objects and other people to function properly as a mind (Sutton, 2010), which renders human beings naturally-born cyborgs (Clark, 1998b, 2001, 2004).</p>\n<p>Reacting to the critique (Adams &amp; Aizawa, 2001), EM theory has moved away from the isomorphic restrictions of the parity principle into its second wave that emphasizes the complementarity of the biological and non-biological. Whereas the first wave of EM flattens out any distinction between the inner and outer components by analysing functionally same elements as equal, the complementarity of the second wave keeps their analytical separation and enables turning our attention to how these components interface between each other. Scholars in EM therefore call for &#8222;a science of the biotechnological mind&#8220; (Clark, 2002) or “the science of the interface” (Sutton, 2010) that would investigate how technology scaffolds our cognition and how the interface brings together and transforms seemingly ontologically stable properties of inner and outer components by the virtue of its mediating effects.</p>\n<p>Although EM thesis emerged in the context of cognitive science and philosophy of mind, from the beginning it used thought experiments of how we interact with technological media (Tetris, paper notebooks) to pump up our old intuitions about the mind and its relationship to the external world. It is this interrelation of philosophy, technology and media that leads me to analyse both sides of the interface, the human and technology, via the core ideas presented in the works of media theory of Marshall McLuhan, who was a vocal proponent of technology bringing about „psychic and societal“ changes in the human affairs.</p>\n<p>The topic of my presentation is to explore extended mind theory on the background of McLuhan’s media theory to sketch an approach to “the science of the interface” where interface can be seen as a mediation process that is always a transformative force between two or more dissimilar sides that needs an element in between to enable their interaction.</p>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>We are living in an age where most of our interactions with other people and the outside world are technologically mediated (Deuze, 2015). Our world is digital, and our technology is ubiquitous. Most of what we call technology, however, stays in the background as a part of massively distributed, multilayered, and interconnected infrastructures (Bratton, 2015).<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> To get an access to their functions, we need an open window that would mitigate and smoothen all the differences between the human being and technology in order to establish the interaction. But what is it that we should see inside the window beside the functional and aesthetical affordances that we as users look for? It turns out that the window that we can call an interface of technology does not represent reality by mimicking it with the strategy of mimesis known in the visual arts. Instead, its strategy is the opposite: to <em>hide </em>the reality of technology by reducing the sheer complexity of technological infrastructures to the level that is perceptible and manageable by human cognitive abilities. On this view, the nature of interface of technologies is being problematized as something much more profound than just the fixed screen displaying a graphical user interface filled with icons and windows that we are familiar with by using today’s personal computers and smart devices. Although the interface of many technological devices has a visual side, in addition  of representing something existing, such as photographs or videos, it is also a new, synthetic image or rather a cognitive map of the technological infrastructure that is created by engineers and designers in order to hide the true complexity of technology and offer only those features that users deem useful.</p>\n<p>Analogously to a language translator or a dispute mediator in law, the interface stands as a third, an element between two sides that cannot otherwise communicate with each other. Specifically, in technology, it creates a relationship between humans and technology. When interface<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> mediates or translates, in other words, work properly, paradoxically something is being lost or transformed, which is, however, a prerequisite for being a medium in the first place because inherent to the process of mediation or translation is a transformation of whatever is being exchanged between the two or more incompatible sides.</p>\n<h2>McLuhan’s medium</h2>\n<p>This is the main idea embodied in the famous dictum “the medium is the message” by the media theorist Marshall McLuhan or the work by the Czech phenomenologist Miroslav Petříček (McLuhan, 1994; Petříček, 2009, Pages 10-12). Following McLuhan, instead of asking questions about the media institutions or the content of media (the content of a book or YouTube videos), we should focus on the technology itself and its formal and unique attributes with which we interact. For McLuhan, technology is an <em>extension</em> of natural sensory capabilities and each extension brings about different changes in our cognition that permeates through individuals to society as a whole. McLuhan devoted his work to mapping out the impact of various technologies such as a phonetic alphabet, a printing press or television on our culture, but also our cognitive abilities. Due to his devotion to the power of technological change, McLuhan has been accused of being a technological determinist. Many sentences in his work indeed read in this manner, for example when he pronounces “the phonetic alphabet, alone, [as] the technology that has been the means of creating ‘civilized man’” (McLuhan, 1994, Page 84) or the bold assertion that “[p]rint created individualism and nationalism in the sixteenth century. Program and ‘content’ analysis offer no clues to the magic of these media […]” (McLuhan, 1994, Pages 19-20). But McLuhan expressed much more nuanced version of the power of technology where the human being and technology influence each other in a cybernetic feedback loop (McLuhan, 1994, Page xxi).</p>\n<p>Should we take McLuhan’s notion of technology extending our senses literally or is it just a wellchosen metaphor by a “mere” English literature scholar? McLuhan was clearly serious about his views on how technology shapes our cognitive abilities when he synthesised the research on the cognition of illiterate people or cognitive and neuroscience research that seemed to vindicate his insistence on the impact of phonetic alphabet leading to a Western, “linear thinking”. (McLuhan, 1978) But how <em>do</em> technology and its interface transform us and our societies when we let them become part of our culture<em>?</em> The answer lies in what McLuhan as one of few humanities scholars studied: a convergence of cognitive science, analysis of our relationships to technologies and the technical knowledge behind the construction of interfaces whereby such relationship is enabled.</p>\n<p>If it is the case that technology transforms us in a non-trivial way, it yields exciting new questions that should not be left to engineers or designers only but should be naturally incorporated into the philosophy of technology. For example, if my iPhone is a part of my cognition, will stealing it be considered a theft but also an assault on my health? If other smart devices are somehow parts of our cognition, does it mean that designers have the power to literally design our minds?</p>\n<p>In the following sections, I will explore how contemporary research in the second wave of extended mind theory, share McLuhan’s project to study how technology <em>extends </em>us. Moreover, I will show the that McLuhan’s insistence on studying the process of mediation, or what we should call the interface (Ferenc, 2018), is embedded in the contemporary EM research even though none necessarily cites the media theorist as a direct source.</p>\n<h1>First-wave extended mind thesis</h1>\n<p>The seminal paper by Clark and Chalmers in 1998 introduced the notion of extendedness of our mind and cognition to the broader cognitive science and philosophy of mind community. Since the publication of the paper, Andy Clark has become one of the main proponents of the thesis, authoring several books about the intimate relationship between humans, technology, and the world.</p>\n<p>External mind (EM) thesis proposes that we should consider the external world as a part of our cognitive processing and under specific circumstances also a part of our mind. Here EM thesis does not solely argue for the common-sense idea that external objects such as technology, when we use them, play an important role in our daily coping with the world. The intimacy of the connection is much more profound and suggest a different picture: technology is not another layer on top of existing fixed biological, cognitive and mind layers, but ontologically saying, it actively <em>co-constitutes</em> all of them. Clark (Clark, 2001) argues in remarkably similar terms as McLuhan before him that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“[…] the tools and culture are indeed as much determiners of our nature as products of it. Ours are (by nature) unusually plastic brains whose biologically proper functioning has always involved the recruitment and exploitation of non-biological props and scaffolds. More so than any other creature on the planet, we humans emerge as natural-born cyborgs”</p></blockquote>\n<p>To help us overcome the bias of internalist view on cognition and mind, the proponents of the thesis employ various thought experiments to “pump up” our intuition. Here I am going to briefly mention four of them: the Richard Feynman remark, a personal story of Patrick James, the deacon in a Catholic church who suffers from amnesia and uses technology to keep his life intact, and the famous Tetris and Inga/Otto thought experiments from the original EM paper.</p>\n<h2>Feynman’s notes</h2>\n<p>Being a famous physicist, Richard Feynman was interviewed by a historian of science, Charles Weiner, about his work routines. Clark in his book <em>Supersizing the mind</em> re-narrates the story of the encounter between those two and mentions the glee with which the historian looked at the work notes and said that it is an important <em>record</em> of Feynman’s work. Feynman struck the historian when he answered that the notes are not the record but the work itself. (Clark, 2008, Page xxv)</p>\n<h2>Patrick James’s memento</h2>\n<p>In the movie Memento, the main character suffers from anterograde amnesia that prevents him from forming new memories and relies on external objects such as Polaroid photographs or body tattoos to reminds himself the essential information. With the same condition fights a real-life person in the US by the name of Patrick Jones, who works as a deacon in a Catholic church (Marcus, 2008). Due to the childhood brain trauma and following concussions, he is also unable to form new memories. In contrast to the character in the movie, Jones relies on the latest technologies to keep his life and job in order. He uses an iPhone and Evernote app to consult whenever he has memory lapses.</p>\n<h2>Tetris</h2>\n<p>The Tetris thought experiment (Clark &amp; Chalmers, 1998) involves a person playing the game. The authors invite us to imagine three similar cases. In the first case, the player mentally rotates the geometrical shapes (or zoids) on the screen in his head. In the second case, the player can rotate the zoids with the use of the keyboard. In the third, cyberpunk-like case the same player has a neural implant that simulates the physical rotation with the keyboard but this time the entire process of the rotation is done by the will of the player inside the head thanks to the cooperation of the brain and the neural implant. The authors of the paper argue that if we do not object to the implant in the third case being part of our cognition, we should regard external resources for cognitive tasks as being cognitive as well. In other words, we should not privilege the skin and the skull to be the boundary of cognition which the authors consider arbitrary and an unsubstantiated historical prejudice.</p>\n<h2>Inga and Otto experiment</h2>\n<p>The famous Inga and Otto experiment tries to show that if our beliefs about the state of the world are external to our head, we should argue that a part of our cognition is extended beyond the brain and skull boundary. The experiment lets us imagine two people, Inga and Otto. Both want to go to see an art exhibition at the MOMA. Inga does not know where the museum is but after consulting her memory, she remembers that the museum is on the 53<sup>rd</sup> street and goes in. Next, imagine Otto who suffers from a mild Alzheimer’s and carries a notebook with himself into which he writes the vital information. Otto also wants to see the exhibition. Naturally, he cannot remember the street but after consulting his notebook, he finds the street address and goes in.</p>\n<p>The authors of the paper suggest following: Otto goes to the museum because he wants to go and because he <em>believed even before consulting his notebook</em> that the museum is on 53<sup>rd</sup> street. We do not have a problem to endorse that Inga believed before consulting her biological memory that she knew where the museum is and the authors argue that Otto’s belief is the same even though the substrate of the memory is different. Clark and Chalmers write that Otto’s memory “functions just like the information constituting an ordinary nonoccurrent belief—it just happens that this information lies beyond the skin” (Clark &amp; Chalmers, 1998)</p>\n<h2>Parity principle</h2>\n<p>The authors do not make their case suggesting that there is <em>no</em> difference between the biological and non-biological memories. Instead, in their original paper, they propose that the external memory device such as a notebook <em>functions</em> as a process that is functionally identical to how the brain works. In fact, this functionalist approach to extended mind thesis represents the core argument later called <em>the parity principle</em> which in the original paper reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“If, as we confront some task, a part of the world functions as a process which, <em>were it done in the head</em>, we would have no hesitation in recognizing as part of the cognitive process, then that part of the world <em>is</em> (so we claim) part of the cognitive process.” (emphasis in the original)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Of course, such a definition may lead to an impossibly broad extension of the mind, counting other people and even the whole internet as parts of our mind. To specify what counts as cognitive in the external world, the authors list four criteria that I will summarize here and that John Sutton (Sutton, 2010) calls “glue and trust” criteria: First, the external object such as Otto’s notebook must be a constant in one’s life, meaning that rarely will a person take action without the external object. Second, the information is readily available. Third, after retrieving the information, the person automatically endorses it. Fourth, the information from the external object has been consciously endorsed in the past. The parity principle is a probe based on the functionalist perspective of the mind designed, as Clark comments, to “free us from mere bio-chauvinistic prejudices”.</p>\n<h2>Active externalism</h2>\n<p>The given examples of Otto or Patrick James should stimulate our intuitions enough to see clearly that taking the external technological objects away from them would drastically reduce their memory and cognitive competency, leading to change in their personalities as well. On this view, we have to acknowledge that the relationship between humans and technological objects is indeed much more intimate and transformative that would otherwise seem. As Clark and Chalmers explain:</p>\n<p>“the human organism is linked with an external entity in a two-way interaction, creating a <em>coupled</em> system that can be seen as a cognitive system in its own right. All the components in the system play an active causal role, and they jointly govern behaviour in the same sort of way that cognition usually does” (Clark &amp; Chalmers, 1998)</p>\n<p>Clark and Chalmers call this coupled human-technology relationship <em>active externalism</em>, distinguishing it from the previously known semantic externalisms advocated by Putnam and Burge. Active externalism, as opposed to passive, semantic externalisms, emphasises the active and direct impact of external objects on our behaviour. Embracing active externalism means that tools and methods for studying and explaining human behaviour must change. Whereas the internalist view on the mind and cognition would argue that to study human cognition requires only to “look inside the head”, active externalism proposes that when we use technological objects and external features of the world, we become participants of higher-order cognitive systems that have emergent properties that we would not otherwise find by a close analysis of individual components of such coupled systems. As the original paper reminds us, active externalism is closely related to other approaches in different fields, such as the distributed cognition approach by Hutchins (Hutchins, 1995) where the cognition is distributed between human agents and external objects, or phenomenologically-inspired situated cognition in human-computer interaction (Suchman, 1987) or robotics and artificial intelligence (Brooks, 1991) in which dynamical, real-time and two-way coupling with the environment serving as its own best representation help humans and robots solve ad-hoc problems.</p>\n<h1>Parity criticism and second-wave EM</h1>\n<p>Although the first-wave EM based on the functionalist parity principle and coupled, two-way interactive systems attracted a large following, it was not without its critics. The main criticism against the firstwave EM came from Adams and Aizawa (Adams &amp; Aizawa, 2001; Adams &amp; Aizawa, 2007).  Their criticisms centres around the notion of “intrinsic content” and the inability to clearly distinguish the “mark of cognitive”. They argue that only internal, that is neural representations have intrinsic content and therefore can be regarded as cognitive, instead of a derivative content that we find in the case of Otto who according to this analysis must first interpret the perceptual data, which is something Inga need not do. Even though Clark responded to these objections and others criticizing the functional similarity of various internal and external processes (Clark, 2005; Clark, 2010), John Sutton (Sutton, 2010) presents another criticism and suggestion that moves the EM thesis beyond the parity principle.</p>\n<p>Sutton warns about the possible problem if we commit ourselves to a strong variant of the parity principle and treat the internal and external components of the cognitive systems as equal. Sutton cites John Haugeland who takes the functionalistic isomorphism to its extreme when he argues that we should not</p>\n<blockquote><p>“treat brain and body as clearly separable components joined at a well-defined psychophysical interface, nor can we slide ‘the hump in the rug’ outward by identifying principles interfaces between body or sense organs and the physical world […] we have to make it all lie flat”. (Haugeland, 1998, Pages 228-229)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Haugeland’s flat ontology without distinction influenced by the parity principle presents an issue if we want to study individual differences among people that “connect” to those extended bio-technological systems via those interfaces that Haugeland dismisses. And Sutton believes that keeping the distinct features of the biological and non-biological is necessary because there are in fact important and interesting differences between humans and artefacts, even though the higher-order extended systems may smooth them “under the rug” as Haugeland claims. As Suttons argues, clearly extended mind research needs to study the human component because humans are not blank slates, having species and individually specific differences. The study of non-human components is necessary as well, no one would argue that Otto’s notebook is the same as Inga’s memory cells in her brain. Moreover, if the parity principle reduces all external artefacts to their functions and interfaces provided to us, we would not need, as Suttons says, “media theory, history, or any other ‘social, cultural, and technological studies’ in cognitive science” (Sutton, 2010, Page 200).</p>\n<p>Therefore, the parity principle must be fundamentally incomplete and at best a sufficient but not a necessary condition for EM thesis. Sutton (Sutton, 2010) therefore suggests loosening the requirements for EM thesis and instead of focusing on the functional isomorphism, we should stress the importance of <em>complementarity </em>of the internal and the external. Such a position of stressing rather the complementarity, according to Sutton, would move the EM thesis to its second wave beyond the parity principle.</p>\n<p>Clark himself says that the brain does not have to replicate whatever useful processes the external objects provide. Rather, it</p>\n<blockquote><p>“must learn to <em>interface</em> with the external media in ways that maximally exploit their particular virtues”. (Clark, 1997, Page 220) (my emphasis)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sutton adds that our brains are “leaky associative engine[s]” that rely on “need media, objects, and other people to function fully as minds”. The complementarity version of EM keeps the distinction between the internal and the external and importantly shifts our attention to how these two parts can, despite their natural differences, actually interact with each other, with which Clark agreed already in 1998, when he suggested that the extended mind thesis should turn “primarily on the way disparate inner and outer components co-operate so as to yield integrated larger systems capable of supporting various […] forms of adaptive success” (Clark, 1998).</p>\n<p>It seems that the first wave was occupied with comparing the emergent <em>outcomes </em>of various interactions between humans and various forms of media as if we were looking at the system from a bird’s perspective. The second wave, however, agrees with the existence and importance of emergent properties on the large scale of extended mind systems, but nevertheless looks closely at the interactions between the system’s components that are the cause of the emergent properties in the first place.</p>\n<p>Andy Clark writes that: “[t]he cash value of the emphasis on extended systems (comprising multiple heterogeneous elements) is thus that it forces us to attend to the interactions themselves: to see that much of what matters about human-level intelligence is hidden not in the brain, nor in the technology, but in the complex […] interactions and collaborations between the two.”</p>\n<p>Then Clark continues with a prophetic voice:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The study of these interaction[s] […] is not easy and depends both on new multidisciplinary alliances and new forms of modelling and analysis. The pay-off, however, could be spectacular: nothing less than a new kind of cognitive scientific collaboration involving neuroscience, physiology, and social, cultural, and technological studies in about equal measure”. (Clark, 2001, Pages 153-154)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sutton calls this turn to study the interactions and relations between the inner and external resources <em>the science of the interface</em>.</p>\n<h1>The science of the interface</h1>\n<p>The primary question in the hypothetical science of the interface is how we interface with technology and what is the taxonomy of interfaces that enable such interaction. The question can be tackled from various sides using the methods and tools from a variety of disciplines, which satisfies Sutton’s and Clark’s call for the interdisciplinary approach to extended mind.</p>\n<p>Through the lens of the science of the interface Sutton explicitly touches upon ontological questions and a subject-object dichotomy when he writes that the second-wave EM must take into account that when the inner and external resources are “brought to the interface with all […] different media and symbolic technologies”, then “interacting with different external artefacts” and “interfacing” with them is “often inherently transformative”. Surprisingly, we can hear in Sutton’s words the fundamental McLuhan’s ideas about the process of mediation as always being transformative as well as the media’s power to bring about “psychic and societal” changes.</p>\n<p>Moreover, McLuhan’s program of studying the historical examples of media and their influences on the society can be clearly seen in the “historical cognitive science” that Sutton argues for. The argument for such activity is in the light of extended mind thesis straightforward: if we agree that cognition is extended and distributed, it means that the brain is a historically influenced “biosocial organ” because of sociocultural layers that have causal power in our cognition. According to Merlin Donald, whom Sutton cites, culturally specific technologies and media “have constituted part of human cognitive architecture since the upper Palaeolithic period” (Sutton, 2008).</p>\n<p>Lastly, the science of the interface must accommodate the role of context in the use of technology. Given the fact that different media and technologies feature different interfaces that will furthermore afford different kinds of interaction based on the contextual clues that a human may or may not take advantage of, Sutton argues that the second-wave EM is “an invitation to give detailed attention to […] differences [in kinds of interaction] in specific contexts and case studies” (Sutton, 2010). Sutton calls for anthropological or ethnographic accounts of how real-world coupling of humans and technologies actually works. The call may remind us of the seminal work by a cognitive ethnographer Edwin Hutchins who developed a related approach to extended mind theory called “distributed cognition” when he published a detailed ethnographic report about the way the ship crew controls a large navy ship by distributed the control over various people and objects (Hutchins, 1995).</p>\n<p>Cognitive anthropological study of the real-world coupling of humans and technology faces a methodological and philosophical issue that phenomenologically informed ethnography is well aware of: studying the use of technology means that we are concerned with practical skills of coping in the world in various types of human activity and the articulation of practical skills, especially at the expert level, proves to be extremely difficult because expertise “relies on an immense reservoir of practical skill memory, embodied somehow in the fibres and in the sedimented ability to sequence technical gestures appropriately, verbal descriptions of it (by either actors or observers) will be inadequate” (Sutton, 2008). For example, we can imagine a situation where we have to explain to visitors from a different planet how humans walk. At a superficial level, the verbal description of walking will be sufficient. But once we are compelled to provide a detailed account of walking, at some level the best we can do is to show <em>how</em> we do that. This invokes the distinction made by Hubert Dreyfus (Dreyfus, 1979; Dreyfus, 1992; Dreyfus, 2009) who, arguing against the older, symbolic approach to artificial intelligence research, divided knowledge into “what” declarative and “how” practical types. Or even Dreyfus’ mentor Heidegger who distinguished between present-at-hand and ready-to-hand (Heidegger &amp; Macquarrie, Robinson, 2006) modes of coping with the world. Once we are becoming proficient enough in any activity involving tools, our perception of the activity undergoes a shift from very deliberate coping where we are highly aware of the tool (present-at-hand mode) to a proficient coping where the tool becomes transparent to us and ceases to occupy our awareness, instead our attention is focused on whatever goal we want to achieve, with the tool becoming an extended part of ourselves. To research coupling of technology and humans at the expert level, we have to immerse in the activity and become through apprenticeship experts ourselves (Sutton, 2008).</p>\n<p>The science of the interface indeed seems like a massively interdisciplinary subject that can be studied via at least four viewpoints. First one resembles Sutton’s project of historical cognitive science that McLuhan was already participating in even before the idea of such field existed and consists primarily of analysing and explaining how past technologies throughout ages co-constituted our cognition and in turn led to changes in society and culture. Second, how and why technology works the way it does and how it interacts with us from the engineering and design point of view. This viewpoint is routinely discussed and solved in the human-computer interaction community. Third, what are the stable psychological and cognitive attributes, if any, with which we bring to the interaction with technology. Fourth, how does the interaction with technology work from the experiential point of view, in other words, how does the interaction with technology reveal for us and what are the transformative effects on our cognition as well as the personal identity? Here, the (post)phenomenological analysis of humantechnology relations and its concept of technological mediation that treats explicitly the co-constitution of humans and technology and dispels with subject-object dichotomy will be helpful. Furthermore, phenomenologically oriented ethnography informs us that the researcher must herself become an expert in a given activity to attain a rich understanding of context-dependent interaction with the tools.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>McLuhan’s life project of mapping out the influence of technology on our cognition, which in turn shapes our culture and society, is increasingly not only vindicated but also developed further by extended mind where McLuhan is not routinely cited, if at all. McLuhan set out to understand the deep effects of technology on our lives and equate historical changes with its introduction to our culture. McLuhan was also the first media theoretician who warned us that if we want to understand the workings of media, we should not be blinded by the content of media and instead turn our attention the formal and technical aspects of how media enable the human-technology interaction.</p>\n<p>Extended mind theory in its second-wave incarnation goes beyond the unreasonably strict functionalist isomorphism of parity principle and the call to flatten out any distinction between the biological and non-biological components of extended cognitive systems. Instead, the second-wave EM acknowledges the obvious deeper and meaningful differences between the components and makes their incompatibility and the possibility of mutual interaction the main issue for extended mind research, which is embodied in the proposed <em>the science of the interface.</em></p>\n<p>By this turn to interaction and interface, extended mind research could benefit greatly from a closer cooperation with already established fields such as media theory, human-computer interaction and (post)phenomenology that treats the mediation effects, interface and human-technology relationships as their main research problem.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>References </strong></h1>\n<p>Adams, F. &amp; Aizawa, K.

Kritický design. Na jedno z prvních představení konceptu Kritického designu se přišla podívat rozmanitá skupina lidí: vedle samozřejmého zájmu z řad praktikujících designérů, umělců a teoretiků umění (v drtivé většině z UMPRUM) se dostavili UX designéři s praxí ze start upů nebo velkých korporátních firem, architekti, socioložka, právník, informační vědec z brněnského KISKu, filozof a teoretici médií a human-computer interaction.</p>\n<p>O úvod k této v českém kontextu ojedinělé akci reflektující současný „kritický“ přístup k designu se ujal Lukáš Pilka. Jako doktorand z UMPRUM si připravil komentář k vybraným pracím z českého prostředí i z proběhlého festivalu <em>Ars Electronica 2018</em>. Během svého příspěvku nás zavedl do problematiky vymezení pole působnosti Kritického designu a jakým způsobem ho lze, případně nelze odlišovat od spekulativního designu. Podle Pilky se v obou případech jedná o přístup k designu, jehož záměrem „je vytvářet a sdílet kritické perspektivy, podněcovat veřejnou debatu a směřovat tak pozornost k společenským, kulturním, politickým nebo etickým problémům&#8220;. Podobně jako Kritická teorie v kulturních studiích a kontinentální filozofii se kritický design snaží o dekonstrukci zavedených procesů ve společnosti a snahu nalézt doposud neexistující alternativy. Jak kritický, tak spekulativní design se snaží o vidění přítomnosti optikou potenciality budoucnosti, kterou ilustrují a zhmotňují produkcí určitých artefaktů, procesů nebo jinak rozpracovaných idejí. Kvůli jejich stejnému cíli se dále hovořilo o spekulativním a kritickém designu jako o synonymech.</p>\n<p>Kritický design je přirozeně politický, neboť kromě analýzy stávajícího stavu společnosti, kultury nebo technologického vývoje se jasně vymezuje vůči existujícímu řádu a navrhuje, jak by věci mohly nebo měly být. Tím aspoň na papíře značně přesahuje tradiční zaměření nejen produktového designu na „artefakt“ a jeho estetiku. Kritický design totiž posouvá design do sféry sociologického zkoumání, kulturní kritiky a v mnoha ohledech nezbytného etnografického výzkumu, jenž designérům poskytuje na reálný kontext vázaná data o aktuálním stavu nějakého společenského problému, na který se kriticky smýšlející designér orientuje.</p>\n<p>I proto mi dává smysl, že se na tento Meetup dostavilo hned několik UX designérů. Jejich náplň práce si v posledních letech prošla značnými změnami: od detailního návrhu určitých „deliverables“ v podobě drátových modelů (wireframes), diagramů, uživatelských cest a interaktivních prototypů jejich role metamorfózovala do jakéhosi holisticky smýšlejícího „guru&#8220;, který koordinuje vizuální designéry, analytiky a programátory takovým způsobem, aby vše ve vztahu k uživateli vykazovalo koherentní a jednotný hlas či značku, se kterou uživatel interaguje na mnoha místech svého každodenního života (mobilní aplikace, webová stránka, kamenný obchod apod.). Také v UX designu se díky lidem jako Don Norman, Alan Cooper nebo inovačnímu studiu IDEO, jež patří mezi nejvlivnější na světě, začaly prosazovat v designu různé kvalitativní i kvantitativní výzkumné metody zaměřené na člověka (Human-centred design) léta zavedené a hojně používané v sociologii, antropologii nebo etnografii.</p>\n<p>Komplexní pojetí problémů ze společenského, kulturního a technologického pohledu je ideálem kritického designu, ale jak Pilka dodává, v mnoha případech tomu tak není. Přestože zaměření na artefakt není nutně problematické ani v kritickém designu, potenciál kritického designu se značně snižuje, pokud se redukuje pouze a jen na objekt a jeho estetizaci. Pilka poukazoval na několik příkladů, kdy tyto zdánlivě radikální designové objekty se staly výstavními objekty v galeriích. To je pro kritický design problém, protože holistické pojetí problémů vyžaduje, aby se bral v potaz širší kontext toho, jak a kde bude designový artefakt používán. Sedí-li artefakt pouze v galerii, jsou výstupy kritického designu značně „dekontextualizované“ a jsou redukovány jen na pozlátka.</p>\n<p>Analogicky si můžeme v UX designu digitálních projektů všimnout, že se často UX zaměňuje za uživatelské rozhraní (UI, User Interface). Tento problém vyvstává z toho, že se v UX proces vedoucí k nějakému výsledku nechápe stejně plnohodnotný jako konečný výstup tohoto procesu, kterým skutečně uživatelské rozhraní zpravidla je. UX design se ale vyznačuje tím, že samotnému vizuálnímu návrhu digitálních produktů předchází náročná výzkumná, analytická i syntetická fáze, která definuje podklady pro vizuální design uživatelské rozhraní. To je finálním výstupem celého UX procesu, ale je to pouze pomyslná špička ledovce. Rozhodně nemůžeme špičku ledovce vyčuhující nad hladinou zaměňovat za celý ledovec, jehož velká část je našemu zraku skryta.</p>\n<p>Pokud bychom tak činili, dopustili bychom se toho, co Martin Heidegger i jeho francouzský následovník Jacques Derrida považovali za největší zločin západního myšlení: privilegování metafyziky přítomnosti, podle které na přítomnost našich životů nahlížím pouze, a právě optikou již dokončené přítomnosti a zanedbáváme tím procesuální (čti evoluční) a historický charakter přítomnosti.</p>\n<p>Pilka dále zmínil něco, co mě potěšilo, neb je to dle mého názoru jeden z nejdůležitějších konceptů filozofie médií vůbec: designové objekty nejsou neutrální. Jak to ale přesně myslel? I když nebyl prostor pro dotazy, mohu se tuto myšlenku pokusit interpretovat. Nejdříve se zaměřím na téma (non)neutrality designu a technologie. Poté nabídnu vlastní příspěvek toho, jak kritický design může čerpat ze současné filozofie techniky.</p>\n<h2>Non-neutralita technologie</h2>\n<p>Již Marshall McLuhan obrátil naši pozornost ve studiu médií k tomu, co média skutečně dělají. Na rozdíl od chápání médií jako určitých institucí se mcluhanovská analýza soustředí na kulturní, společenské, ale také technické aspekty toho, jak „média mediují&#8220;. Prototypickou tezí McLuhana je, že každé uvedení nové technologie do společnosti (McLuhan zaměňuje média za technologie a opačně) vede ke změnám v našem senzorickém aparátu a v tom, jakým způsobem přistupujeme ke světu. Jinak řečeno, nové technologie upravují a rozšiřují naše vnímání světa. První mikroskopy nám odkryly velmi aktivní mikro svět, Hubbleův teleskop nám poskytl dech beroucí snímky enormních a prastarých těles našeho vesmíru, antikoncepční pilulky daly ženám do rukou mocný nástroj pro kontrolu reprodukce a konečně budoucí rodiče mohou díky ultrazvuku vidět své dítě před narozením a na základě analytických dat rozhodnout o jeho životě &#8211; moc, která byla dříve přisuzována pouze Bohu. Zavedení technologie do společnosti znamená rozšiřování našich perceptuálních a kognitivních schopností a ty následovně mění podobu naší kultury a společnosti. Technologie z tohoto pohledu nejsou neutrální, ale obsahují v sobě určité algoritmy nebo potencialitu toho, jak na nás technologie bude působit. McLuhan byl několikrát obviňován z technologického determinismu, neboť více kritické interpretace jeho díla tvrdí, že pro McLuhana zavedení nějaké technologie vede nevyhnutelně, tedy deterministicky, k určitým efektům nezávisle na kulturním a společenském kontextu.</p>\n<p>I když nesouhlasím s tímto nařčením McLuhana, v případě otázky neutrality, anebo vlivu technologie se v poslední době obracím k postfenomenologické analýze technologií. Mezi předními jmény postfenomenologie patří její zakladatel, americký filozof Don Ihde, a také Ihdeho následovník nizozemský filozof Peter-Paul Verbeek, který působí při Univerzitě Twente. Postfenomenologii již podle svého jména vychází z fenomenologie Martina Heideggera a rozvíjí jeho dílo o větší zaměření na technologie. Jedním z hlavních principů postfenomenologie je fenomenologická analýza vztahů mezi člověkem a technologií, především způsob, jakým technologie mediují náš vztah ke světu. To už zkoumal i McLuhan. Kde se postfenomenologie štěpí od mediálních studií, je tzv. vzájemná konstituce člověka a technologie. Koncept technická mediace analyzovaná z pohledu (post)fenomenologie totiž zdůrazňuje, že mediace není pouhý proces, během kterého jsou lidský subjekt a jeho prožitky ovlivněné technologickými objekty. Technická mediace je mnohem radikálnější. Tvrdí, že vztah mezi subjektem a objektem je důležitější, protože až během tohoto vztahu reálně subjekt a objekt vznikají. Jinak řečeno, technická mediace není jakási neutrální síla, která probíhá mezi ontologicky stabilním a fixním subjektem a objektem, nýbrž tato síla teprve formuje na ontologické úrovni vlastnosti objektu a subjektu. Postfenomenologie tedy neodmítá kartesiánský dualismus subjektu a objektu. Zásadně jej ale modifikuje tím, že nepovažuje subjekt a objekt za fixní entity, ale za výsledky interakce mezi člověkem a světem, kde tato interakce je zprostředkována technologií.</p>\n<h2>Kritický design a filozofie techniky</h2>\n<p>Pokud technologie má na nás takto zásadní vliv, to samé musíme říct o designérech. Designéři jsou zodpovědní za věci kolem nás. V závislosti na svém společenském vlivu každá technologie přináší větší nebo menší balík potenciálních změn toho, jak vidíme svět, ale i sami sebe. Na začátku se nám nová technologie může zdát cizí a nedokážeme si představit, jak bychom ji mohli produktivně ve svém životě využít. Postupem času se ze svého zjevného, až hypermediovaného stavu začne technologie vytrácet do pozadí našich životů. Stane se jedním z mnoha prvků technologické infrastruktury, bez kterého bychom si nedokázali představit naše životy. Jedním z úkolů kritického designu, jak jej vidím já, je fundamentálně to, o čem hovořil již McLuhan: důležitým úkolem kritického přístupu umělce je vyzvednout do popředí technologie, které jsou pro nás tak transparentní a samozřejmé, že před nimi ztrácíme ostražitost. Měli bychom být kritičtí vůči tomu, jakým způsobem transformují naše životy. Avšak většina společnosti k tomu nemá dostatečně vybavený a trénovaný cit. Právě proto je společensky nezastupitelná role umělkyň a umělců, kteří dokáží zhmotnit a spekulativním způsobem naznačit možné funkce a vlivy nové i staré technologie. Tento cyklický proces hypermediace =&gt; immediace a opětovné hypermediace technologie popsali Mcluhanové v knize <em>Laws of Media</em> jako Retrieval. Retrieval popisuje funkce, akce nebo služby, které jsou opět znovu uvedeny ve společnosti do popředí po zavedení nové technologie.</p>\n<p>Vhodný příklad tohoto jednoho ze čtyř mcluhanovských zákonů médií najdeme v eseji Alfanumerická společnost významného česko-židovského filozofa médií, Viléma Flussera, který po nucené emigraci dlouhá léta žil a akademicky působil v Brazílii. Flusser popisuje stručnou historii abecedy a jejího vlivu na společnost. Znalost abecedy byla až do Gutenberga doménou elitních vrstev společnosti a především kněžstva, kdežto většina společnosti komunikovala ústně. Gramotnost představovala sociální výhodu a aktivní znalost použití této „technologie“ svému uživateli poskytovala moc. S příchodem knihtisku a demokratizace knih se ze specializované činnosti čtení stala aktivita, která představovala utilitu i pro širší společnost. Primát klasické abecedy přirozeného jazyka začal být ve dvacátém století potlačován s příchodem digitálních počítačů a logického tlaku na matematizaci společnosti. Jedním z vrcholů digitalizace společnosti je pohlcení všech „starých“ médií, například fotografie nebo filmu, digitálními počítači a konkrétně aplikacemi typu Instagram, Amazon Audible a YouTube. Především YouTube a Audible, respektive audio knihy obecně nám poskytují zajímavou podívanou, když opět masově uvádí do popředí mluvené slovo. Milióny lidí nyní nečtou klasické knihy, ale poslouchají profesionální hlas člověka, který knihu předčítá. Přestáváme číst novinové úvahy a eseje, místo toho si na YouTube pustíme našeho oblíbeného Youtubera &#8211; překvapivou novou dominující kulturní entitu -, aby nám mohl vlastními slovy říct něco o současné politické situaci. Mluvené slovo vytlačuje strukturovaný lineární text. Práce s texty a vysoká gramotnost se opět navrací do specializované oblasti akademického bádání a elitních vrstev, které mají ještě čas na to si vyhradit čas na čtení.</p>\n<p>Jaké to bude mít důsledky pro společnost, vzdělávací instituce a metody učení, gramotnost, a nakonec naši schopnost se soustředit na náročnou, lineární činnost, kterou čtení dozajista je? To jsou z mého pohledu tradiční otázky z filozofie a sociologie techniky. Tyto akademické obory nabízí hypotézy, empirická data a analýzy směřování současné situace. V čem jsou tyto obory mnohem méně zdatné, a to zcela programově, jsou spekulativní představy o budoucnosti. Zároveň velmi omezeně nám podávají výpověď o tom, jak se v takové budoucnosti budeme cítit.</p>\n<p>Kritický design je přirozeným partnerem filozofického bádání. Má potřebné nástroje a sadu dovedností k tomu, aby z abstraktního udělal něco uchopitelného. <em>Philosophy made flesh</em>.</p>\n<p>Aby skutečně kritický design mohl nabídnout vhodný alternativní pohled na problematické části naší kultury a společnosti, měl by se poučit z problémů UX designu a brát v potaz současné ultra-moderní přístupy ke studiu interakce člověka, technologie a prostředí. Přístupy, které nacházejí svůj původ v kybernetice druhého řádu a explicitně preferují holistické a systémové pohledy na technologii. Kritickému designu pomůže překonat své zahledění na artefakt, pokud si designéři uvědomí, že vedle samotných technologických objektů jsou mnohem zajímavější prostředí a platformy, které nové technologie cíleně nebo neplánovaně vytvářejí.</p>\n<p>McLuhan ve své <a href=\"http://www.marshallmcluhanspeaks.com/lecture/1970-living-in-an-acoustic-world/\">přednášce <em>Living in the Acoustic World</em></a> artikuloval dobře ekologický pohled na technologii: automobil sám o sobě nemá žádný význam, pokud by neexistovala infrastruktura silnic, dálnic a obecně možnosti dopravy. Automobil je jen zjevným povrchem mnohem hlubšího a komplexnějšího systému vztahů mezi infrastrukturou, sociální praxí a jednotlivými technologickými objekty. Během řízení je to dokonce pouze část automobilu, která nás propojuje do onoho komplexního systému dopravy: je to volant, řadící páka, různé budíky. Jinak řečeno, uživatelské rozhraní automobilu je branou do hlubšího povrchu systému dopravy.</p>\n<p>Chceme-li tedy zkoumat současné vztahy člověka, společnosti a technologie, musíme se jako designéři, HCI odborníci a teoretici zaměřit nejen na povrch interface (rozhraní) technologií, jakožto místo, kde se všechny zmíněné strany explicitně potkávají, ale zároveň na hlubší, infrastrukturální části, které nám zůstávají většinu dobu skrytu.</p>\n<p>Úkole kriticky smýšlejících designérů je archeologickou metodou odkrýt to, co považujeme za neproblematické a samozřejmé. Jít za povrch věcí a dekonstruovat naši nevědomost o tom, co s námi techno-média dělají. To vyžaduje více než jen estetický cit nebo řemeslnou zručnost, nýbrž také výbornou znalost toho, jak se věci dostaly do současného stádia neboli co vše předchází a následuje potom, co zmáčkneme na svém chytrého telefonu nějaké tlačítko, nebo si můžeme pustit vodu z kohoutku.</p>\n<p>Britský básník a expat žijící v USA, T. S. Eliot, ve své eseji <em>Tradition and the Individual Talent</em> kdysi napsal, že básník by měl být spojen s tradicí svého oboru. Měl by být schopný vnímat „historicitu historie“ a „historicitu přítomnosti“. Kritický designér by měl podobně vnímat historicitu problémů, na kterých pracuje nejen z hlediska evoluce v čase, ale možná překvapivě i v prostoru. Vnímat problém nikoli jako problém vytvořit nějaký objekt, ale jako nutnost re-designovat časoprostorovou strukturu prostředí a systému, ve kterém bude objekt existovat.</p>\n<p>Z takového systémového pohledu pak kritický designér může například pomoci udržitelného a ekologičtějšímu světu spíše než krásným kelímkem z bambusu radikální kampaní, který odkryje nesmyslnost plýtvání ovocem nebo zeleninou kvůli tomu, že nesplňují domnělé nároky na vizuální atraktivitu. Dekonstrukce této praktiky totiž zjistila, že lidé jsou mnohem racionálnější a méně zhýčkaní a pochopí, že pokud jsou potraviny nezávadné, nezdráhají se je koupit, neboť vzhled u většiny lidí není hlavním kritériem při nákupu.</p>\n<p>Myslet časoprostorově, strukturálně a systémově, včetně dovednosti navrhnout prototyp řešení. To je z mého pohledu agenda pro kritický design.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Zdroj: https://www.facebook.com/events/2129142317335432/ Na začátku října se 3. 10. konalo v pražském DOXu setkání lidí, které spojoval zájem o tzv.

There are myriad reasons for this praise. Among them is the simple fact that in today’s world, called by many scholars variously as the information age, network society or post-industrial and cognitive age (Castells &amp; Cardoso, 2006, p. 4-5; Imbesi; Dijk, 2006, p. 19), technology and technological work are deeply interwoven into the structure of our societies. The ever-closing integration of technology and humans is manifested by contemporary approaches such as the Ubiquitous computing and Internet of Things, with sensors and smart devices monitoring, analysing and predicting what we do, or could or should do. To study both technology and society then demand that we consider their mutual influences and co-constitution; the approach that goes beyond the myopic variants of technological or sociocultural determinisms.</p>\n<p>The HCI field seems to be well-equipped for the task. In its genes has the focus on all the necessary components: humans, technology <em>and</em> the design and evaluation of their interaction. The broadly accepted beginning of the computer-based era of HCI can be traced to the year of 1983 when the book <em>The psychology of human-computer interaction </em>was published (Card, Moran, &amp; Newell, 1983). The text applied the contemporary research in psychology and cognitive sciences to studying individual users and designing, evaluation and testing of information systems (Carroll, 2003; Turner, 2016). The book also brought to HCI the then-dominant <em>cognitivistic </em>paradigm. Cognitivism presupposes that everything that matters to cognition, sense-making, or even the mind is found between the boundaries of skull and skin, everything else is just the input sense data that are processed by the brain and send as an output to bodily functions. The mental states and cognition can be compared to the workings of a digital computer because cognition is seen as information-processing and manipulation of mental representations in the form of physical symbols and following of fixed, algorithm-like rules (Brey, 2001, p. 41; Winograd, 1987, p. 25). Under the influence of cognitivistic paradigm, the HCI thrived and its ideological coherence was proclaimed the golden age of the field (Carroll, 2003).</p>\n<p>With the advent of personal computing, computer technology has shifted from an expensive and arcane tool for specialists to become a common work accessory and recently a set of smart devices that accompany us everywhere. In addition, the computing concepts such as ubiquitous computing and Internet of Things have announced the continual disappearance of technology and its embedding into the socio-technical fabric of contemporary life. These technological changes in the society impacted the HCI field as well. Suddenly, the static space of an office desk and sterile laboratories were incapable to capture the complexity and “messiness” of technology use in every day’s contexts. New related domains to HCI such as Computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) emerged, focusing on the work context and diverse types of interactions between a worker and the group. Furthermore, participatory design methods emerged during the socialist government rule in Scandinavian countries of the 1970s and 1980s to foster democracy at work, promoting the cooperation between designers and workers who provided a domain-specific expertise.</p>\n<p>Crucially, even within the fields of HCI and cognitive science were voices critical of the cognitivistic dogma: cognitive scientists, philosophers, artificial intelligence researchers or anthropologists like Don Norman, Hubert Dreyfus, Terry Winograd or Lucy Suchman offered critical evaluation of cognitivism and its image of human cognition as a disembodied mind imposing abstract and value-free reasoning upon the world. The mentioned academics were looking for a radically different intellectual framework that would oppose the limiting cognitivism. They found the answer in the ideas of the phenomenological philosopher Martin Heidegger. Especially, Dreyfus’ critique of the then-dominant cognitivistic program in the artificial intelligence research (Dreyfus, 1979; Dreyfus, 1992) introduced Heidegger to the whole, then predominantly technical fields that had been struggling for some time in fulfilling the promises of creating a truly general artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Later, Winograd and Suchman provided a cogent critique of cognitivism and rule-based cognition in HCI (Winograd, 1987; Suchman, 1987). By suggesting that a user of computer-based systems, such as handling of a complex office printer, on which Suchman did her empirical research, does not follow rules, but instead interprets the situation with the help of pre-existent knowledge and is solving problems <em>ad-hoc</em> based on the available resources at hand, brought to the mainstream light in HCI the phenomenological ideas of hermeneutics and the concept of being-in-the-world. Phenomenologically influenced novel approaches in HCI started to stress the importance of “embodiment” and “situatedness” of human action, contextual aspects of sense-making and a tightly coupled relation between humans and technological artefacts, which brought HCI close to social sciences. HCI practitioners started to appropriate sociological and anthropological methods for gathering information and requirements for system design. Cognitive science also moved away from dogmatic cognitivism, instead embracing alternative approaches to study the mind and cognition, often called, in contrast to cognitivism, <em>post-cognitivistic</em> (Kaptelinin &amp; Nardi, 2006). Apart from activity theory, distributed and extended cognition, Kaptelinin and Nardi re-introduced phenomenology to HCI.</p>\n<h2>Technology as a medium</h2>\n<p>Scholars in the philosophy of technology and new media studies (Deuze, 2015; Manovich, 2002; Verbeek, 2015) agree that technologies mediate all aspects of our lives and it is increasingly difficult to get away from the situation, which led Mark Deuze to propose that instead of combating the technological mediation, we should accept it. It resonates also in the work of a Czech phenomenologist, professor Miroslav Petříček, who writes that:</p>\n<p>“Through media we get access to the world and reality, they are a tool for understanding the reality […] simultaneously by media we share our knowledge about the reality: our relation to the reality is not direct, it is <em>mediated</em>, between our cognizing and the reality stands the medium – in the sense of a fatal split or a gap. The medium enables the contact with the reality, but this contact is conditioned (realized by a distance), it is simultaneously the reference to the loss of immediacy, innocence.” (Petříček, 2009, p. 13)</p>\n<p>Petříček and other phenomenologist studying technology, most famously post-phenomenological philosopher of technology Don Ihde (1990), are suggesting a radical rupture between the human and the world: not only does technology extends quantitatively our already existing capabilities, but also brings about qualitative changes that were not necessarily consciously designed for. Verbeek (2015) gives his favourite example of ultrasound examination as a disruptive technology, enabling future parents to see the unborn child and decide his or her future according to the information provided by the interface screen and other analytical measurements. But even other, more typical technologies such as microscopes, telescopes, cars, internet have opened up before us new worlds and possibilities that have been transforming our relationship to the world and even to ourselves since their introduction. It was the media theorist Marshall McLuhan (1991) and Don Ihde (1990) who articulated the notion that introducing a new technology has a profound effect on our lives. The effect is not in the form of determinism, but in what Ihde calls <em>non-neutrality</em> of technology, which always amplifies and reduces certain parts of our reality for its functioning. For example, a microscope reveals to us a new, microscopic realm of the reality, but at the same time reduces our ability to perceive the “normal” realm of everyday reality.</p>\n<p>Technology is a medium between humans and the world. It ties them together in a new system of human-technology-environment relations. To study the life of a human community, especially in the technologically developed parts of the world, it is necessary to include the technology into the equation. Conversely, the study of how technology influences our lives as well as the study of the current use of technology for the specification of future technological design requires from HCI field incorporating anthropological methods. It is then reasonable to look into the anthropological literature to find about how it treats studying the complexities of human behaviour. The anthropologist whose work I am going to explore in the following section is Tim Ingold, who fittingly represents a phenomenological orientation to the theoretical and philosophical problems in anthropology.</p>\n<h2>Anthropological view on cognition and perception in Tim Ingold</h2>\n<p>Naturally, other fields also stumbled upon the question of what role plays cognition and the environment in our behaviour. Anthropology is one of the fields that discusses implicitly the same problematic assumptions of the cognitivistic paradigm that we mentioned in the context of HCI. Anthropologist Tim Ingold summarizes in his book <em>The Perception of the Environment</em> the differing positions on cognition of two leading intellectuals of the 20<sup>th</sup> century: Gregory Bateson and Claude Lévi-Strauss. Both assert that the mind is a processor of information which falls under the umbrella of cognitivism, yet there are also differences.</p>\n<p>As Ingold writes, “[f]or Lévi-Strauss, both the mind and the world remain fixed and immutable, while information passes across the interface between them.” (Ingold, 2001, p. 18). For Lévi-Strauss, there is no significant connection between the inner and the outer of our minds. Ontologically speaking, the mind and the world are distinct entities, not contributing to each other nor co-constituting the essence of the other. Because of that, Lévi-Strauss represents the traditional dichotomies of Western intellectual heritage existing since Descartes. His view privileges the idea of universal, abstract intellect, observing the world from the a-contextual and value-free point of view resembling how we conceptualize the ideal case of scientific thinking. Ingold adds in his essay that Lévi-Strauss saw cognition as an information-processing that operates on the data coming from the senses which are <em>already pre-structured,</em> and it is the task of the mind to <em>re-construct this already present structure </em>of the sense data. It suggests that for Lévi-Strauss the world itself is pre-structured, waiting for us to pick the reality up if our senses are attuned to the world correctly.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Bateson sees the mind as fundamentally embedded in the world, being a part of the totality of the organism-environment system. Bateson’s view on the relationship between the mind and the environment is much more ecological in the sense that the entities do not have a fixed nature but their “ontological identity” is continually re-negotiated through the dynamic interactions between the components of the ecological system (the mind, the environment). Bateson gives us a famous example where we are to imagine a blind man with a cane (Bateson, 1973). According to Ingold. Bateson maintains that the cane for a blind person is so crucial to her orienting in the world that it functions as an artificial sensory addition to the natural five senses.</p>\n<p>Bateson’s perspective of the ecological closely maps the assumptions held by Ingold. In fact, Ingold’s agenda is to dismantle the old dichotomies of nature and culture. Instead, agreeing with Bateson, he proposes “the dynamic synergy of organism and environment, in order to regain a genuine ecology of life” (Ingold, 2011, p. 16) whereby the ecology should analyse the human and the environment as one, indivisible unit. The focus of the study would, therefore, be the “organism-environment relations” and the mutual interactions thereof.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/levi-strauss-bateson.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1205\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/levi-strauss-bateson.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/levi-strauss-bateson.png 441w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/levi-strauss-bateson-150x150.png 150w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/levi-strauss-bateson-300x300.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1 Schematic comparison of Lévi-Strauss&#8217;s and Bateson&#8217;s views on mind and ecology as presented by Ingold (2011, p. 18)</p>\n<p>This ambitious view on the integration of humans into their environment as being by definition inseparable for the purposes of the analysis poses several theoretical and practical challenges. The significance of our environment presupposes that not all findings can be neither universalised nor transferrable over different contexts without losing the original purpose or meaning. The role of the meaning of human actions and even artefactual objects is also context-dependent. Moreover, the environment changes and suggests new ways of “doing and comprehending things”. Not surprisingly, Ingold, therefore, talks about the organism-environment unit, not as an object, but a process and a constant flux of differences that come together for a period of time just to be changed again.</p>\n<p>To speak of environment does not mean referring only to the immediate physical reality we inhabit, but also the higher layers of social and cultural spheres. Citing other scholars, Ingold agrees with the idea that socio-cultural knowledge and “tools” such as the language shape the way we perceive the world and our conscious <em>and</em> unconscious responses to the environment. Specifically, the socio-cultural background provides a lens or “discriminating grid” through which we impose order on the “flux of raw experience” (Ingold, 2011, p. 158). Here is Ingold again more Batesonian than Lévi-Straussian. If perception was based only on proper, mechanical functioning of the senses re-presenting the world to our mind, as Lévi-Strauss maintained, we would more or less see the world in the same manner. But as anthropologists know, this is clearly not the case. Instead, the socio-cultural background <em>and </em>our situatedness in the environment shapes how we <em>interpret </em>the world. The meaning of objects in the environment is not inherent to the environment or the objects themselves but is <em>the result</em> of the interaction between all the subcomponents of the organism-environment system (between the human and the environment). By interaction, we also mean how specifically are the objects used. Ingold comments that it is by the “virtue of their [objects] incorporation into a characteristic pattern of day-to-day activities” that the meaning is being assigned in respect to the “relation contexts of people’s practical engagement with their lived-in environments” (Ingold, 2011, p. 168). Ingold extends here the late Wittgenstein’s idea of the language. In the posthumously published <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, Wittgenstein originates the idea that words obtain the meaning through the practical, everyday use within a given community of practice (Wittgenstein, 2009). But the same approach can be applied to the behaviour of humans where behaviour can be analysed as a sequence of non-linguistic signs.</p>\n<p>In explaining the meaning and the occurrence of patterns of human behaviour belongs to what anthropology aims for (as opposed to finding the propositional truth of statements, for example), how do we go about studying the <em>meaning</em> of human action if we want to provide an in-depth explanation?</p>\n<p>Within the ecological framework advocated by Ingold, the precision of our explanation “why” will be tied, somewhat, arbitrarily, to what we consider a “good enough” explanation. The reason is that once we agree upon taking into account the whole holistic web of interactions and interrelations that all contribute to the final trigger of why people act certain way or why objects acquire meanings when used in practice, it is impossible to provide a full explanation because certain causations will be always hidden from the researcher. And from the individual actor as well because we cannot expect either that people, in general, are able to verbalize their own behaviour.</p>\n<p>To explain why I consider the “why” question impossible to answer fully, I shall mention Michael Polanyi, who articulated the now famous distinction between the knowledge of “what” and knowledge of “how”. The “how” knowledge, oftentimes synonymous with “tacit knowledge” is difficult to put into words, especially for someone highly skilled in a given domain. Once we get used to doing something, it becomes for us automatically and intuitive. For example, a skilful carpenter working with a hammer will seldom focus his attention on the hammer itself, rather he will focus on the goal to fix furniture for which a hammer is only a mediating tool. For the carpenter, in order to explain “how” most of the time will prove to be the best option simply to demonstrate how he goes about hammering. This applies to any skilful activity or expertise involving the eye-body coordination.</p>\n<p>Returning to the “why” question, it also features a tacit dimension that consists exactly of the holistic web of relations that are extremely difficult to uncover satisfactorily. Any descriptive account of a human action will have to deal with the “surface” and “deep” layers where the surface layers are visible to an eye, whereas the full description, however “thick”, of the deep layer will be lacking.</p>\n<h2>Surface and depth layers of reality</h2>\n<p>It seems to me that there are several already existing approaches to explain further the distinction between the surface and the depth in explaining “why” of human action. For example, anthropology already uses the terminology of “etic” and “emic” originating from linguistic terms phon<em>etic</em>s and phon<em>emic</em>, respectively. Etic methodology pursues a field study from the perspective of the outsider with the goal to study “behavior as from outside of a particular system”, whereas the “emic viewpoint results from studying behavior as from inside the system” (Pike, 1967, p. 37) The etic approach aim to provide a scientifically objective account of the behaviour from which a researcher consequently tries to derive an objective laws about the studied community that can be generalized across cultures. The emic approach, on the other hand, aims to take the researcher into the community who will become one of the members, studying and understanding the subtleness of behaviour and the meaning behind it.</p>\n<p>To my mind, there is no doubt that the etic approach can capture many valuable observations regarding the behaviour, but without the access to insider knowledge, it stays on the surface of the behaviour. Using only the etic approach reduces the real-life complexities and irreducible quality of meaning and human actions to “appearances” or the surface layer. Against this reduction to appearances already warned Bateson with his “objection to mainstream natural science [&#8230;] [that reduces] ‘real’ reality to a pure substance, thus relegating form to the illusory epiphenomenal world of appearances” (Ingold, 2011, p. 16). Bateson here criticizes that the mainstream science privileges explaining (away) phenomena by describing what it looks like and neglects the underlying and most of the time invisible forces that nevertheless shape, cause or create conditions for the visible result. What are the hidden “depths” that emerge as a surface layer?</p>\n<p>The question inevitably leads to asking what gives the shape or meaning to our actions. According to Ingold and Bateson, we find the answer in analysing the behaviour of people within the web of relations of the holistic system called organism-environment, with the socio-cultural past and present a part of the “environment”. What are the surface and depth layers in technology?</p>\n<p>For the answer, it is helpful to browse through the history of modern computing that started in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The first mainframe and programmable computers were as large as one room and to change their behaviour was possible only by physically altering the configuration of electric cables. Later on, from programming done in the “raw” binary code, through the assembly compilers to the first high-level programming languages. Every change simplified the use of computers by putting more intermediate layers that <em>abstracted</em> the user from the underlying physical hardware by providing an access to the computing resources via a symbolic, textual, graphical or another type of interface. Paul Dourish (2004) summarizes the history of computing as a history of continual abstraction.</p>\n<p>It is true that the process of abstracting the complexities of hardware enabled significantly more people using computers and computing devices in their lives. Especially after the advent of mass-marketed personal computers equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI), people learned very quickly that they can handle their work just by controlling the new visual language symbolized by the desktop paradigm that provided an accessible and easily recognizable metaphoric UI resembling the real-life office environment. But the abstraction has also had what I consider negative consequences: our relationship with computers is, in fact, a relationship with the interface because, for the majority of the population, the reality of computers is incomprehensible. For the majority, computers are what they can do with them, which means that when talking about computers people mean <em>their interface</em>, rather than the hidden infrastructure.</p>\n<p>It becomes even more problematic when designers focus only on the surface layer of technology (or their interface). It may lead to a more aesthetically pleasing graphical design, but can it automatically satisfy other requirements, such as functional needs or general meaningfulness of user experience when using computers? Having analysed the current trend in HCI design of digital technologies, the focus on providing meaningful user experience (Ferenc, 2016), I believe that HCI design faces the very similar theoretical and empirical issues shared also by anthropology: it is the problem of going beyond the superficial appearances of the surface layer, be it an observable behavioural patterns or the surface layer of the technological interface (cannot we both behavioural patterns and an technological interface call an interface mediating between the visible surface and the invisible depths?), and explain the deeper layers of why we do things certain way. For HCI design, however, the quest becomes even more pertinent because this knowledge is used for design and evaluation of technological objects and services that millions of people use on the daily basis.</p>\n<p>Being phenomenologically oriented, both anthropology and “post-cognitivistic” HCI design call for a more holistic, or ecological study of individuals, groups, and the emergence of meaning and “sociocultural-technical” order. Both disciplines also have to deal with what I called the surface and the depth layers.  In the following parts of the text, I would like to analyse this dichotomy on the background of Martin Heidegger’s hermeneutical phenomenology as presented in his magnum opus <em>Being and time</em> with the additional commentary made by the contemporary philosopher and a great Heidegger’s interpreter Graham Harman.</p>\n<h2>Heidegger’s phenomenology</h2>\n<p>Heidegger’s <em>Being and Time</em> can be also summarized as criticising “the metaphysics of presence”. By that Heidegger means that “Western philosophy has consistently privileged that which <em>is</em>, or that which appears, and has forgotten to pay any attention to the condition for that appearance. In other words, presence itself is privileged, rather than that which allows presence to be possible at all &#8211; and also impossible” (Reynolds, 2018).</p>\n<p>In many ways, Heidegger&#8217;s project is also a response to Edmund Husserl, the former teacher and the founder of phenomenology. Husserl maintained in his philosophy the influence of Cartesian dualisms when he postulated the transcendental ego. This disembodied consciousness reduced the reality to the constant flow of phenomena as if we are frozen at the place and watching a television screen. Moreover, Husserl believed that we had a direct relationship with the world through the intentional objects in our minds that we could directly perceive if only we “bracket” the other cognitive functions that could spoil the pure empirical or sensorial content in our mind.</p>\n<p>Heidegger rejected Husserl’s transcendental ego and with that Cartesian privileging of mind over body, as well as epistemology over ontology. For Heidegger, it was not the “cogito” but the question of the Being, or the “sum” part of the famous dictum, that presented the philosophical conundrum completely misunderstood in the Western philosophy since Plato. Instead, Heidegger proposed that the reality is “deeper” than just the phenomena we can see because these phenomena have to emerge from somewhere, and for Heidegger, this “somewhere” is the phenomenal background of our world. To understand this phenomenal background, it is useful to look at the notion of how Heidegger sees a human being as a Dasein.</p>\n<h3>Dasein</h3>\n<p>Dasein is a German term that Heidegger uses for writing about a human without the baggage of all the connotations and denotations that we normally associate with the word. Dasein is or Heidegger the most important essence because it differs from the rest by virtue of it is “Being [..] that Being is an <em>issue</em> for it.” (Heidegger, 2006, p. 32/12) In other words, Dasein is the only Being that problematizes its own existence. Moreover, Dasein understands its being because it is inherently being-in-the-world. Compared to Husserl, the human is being transformed from an abstract and disembodied consciousness to an entity intimately linked to the world. Dasein is situated and embodied in the spatial, temporal and other contextual aspects of the world.</p>\n<p>The temporality of Dasein is not simply an existence on a timescale, but the fact that we have at our disposition our social and cultural past that influences the way we interact with the world. Heidegger was very much interested in the everydayness of our existence, which he claimed is our default mode of being: everydayness of dealing with the world makes sense to us because we also exhibit what Heidegger calls “Care” about our being. The practical and every day’s dealing with the world and objects therein in order to achieve whatever goals we set up to achieve is the default mode of our being, while the theoretical and descriptive observation of the world is more specialized, rarer, and usually left to the sciences.</p>\n<p>The practical, every day dealing with the world versus the theoretical mode are two principal modes of interacting with the world, which Heidegger analyses further in his famous “tool analysis” part of <em>Being and Time</em>. Graham Harman considers the tool analysis the most important innovation within the Heideggerian corpus and everything else mere commentaries on this discovery (Harman, 2002).</p>\n<h3>Tool analysis</h3>\n<p>Although the name could suggest otherwise, Harman warns us that by “a tool” we should not think of any specific technological tool, but rather generic things we can use “in-order-to”, for something. There are two modes whereby we can have a relationship to entities: presence-at-hand and readiness-to-hand.</p>\n<p>Presence-at-hand is a relationship with the entities when their appearance become for us a mere “physical lump” or set of attributes. Presence-at-hand is a theoretical dealing with entities where we are fully aware of them. We can see that this mode is rather similar to Husserl’s transcendental consciousness and generally cognitivist claim across many domains where to know or to grasp the being of an entity means to describe how it appears to our consciousness.</p>\n<p>Readiness-to-hand is the other mode and central idea in Heidegger’s phenomenology. The entities that are for Dasein “ready to hand” mediate Dasein’s relationship to the world and are used by Dasein for its practical dealing with the world. Entities in this mode are not the centre of our attention, on the contrary if they are authentically ready-to-hand, our attention becomes increasingly focused on the goal we want to achieve and the entity such as a hammer will become for our consciousness the more transparent the better it helps us achieves our goals, or as Heidegger says, our<em> work</em>. Readiness-to-hand is not possible to study from a detached, theoretical and disembodied point of view; any observation of appearance of a tool cannot uncover the readiness-of-hand of an entity because to understand its readiness-to-hand, one has to use it practically. But there are also possibilities of how ready-to-hand entities can become present-to-hand. It happens when entities “brake down” if they do not do what is expected of them.</p>\n<p>According to Heidegger, what makes entities ready-to-hand is that entities always belong to a large web of other entities (tools) that Heidegger calls an “equipmental totality”. In other words, the equipment functions and has certain meanings for us thanks to its relations to other entities. The number and complexity of these relations are recursive and potentially infinite.</p>\n<p>Heidegger talks about a larger contextual reality in which even a simple tool like a pencil belongs to the equipmental totality of other writing tools such as a paper, but also the context of the general activity of writing. We cannot forget that Heidegger studies the being of things. And the being of a tool is its relational character to other tools. To give just more examples, consider a car. Its meaning and functions are shaped by its membership to a set of other cars, roads, driving licences, urban laws for drawing, etc. Or the case of money. Of itself, it is a worthless piece of paper (or a digital signature). However, only after we agree upon money being a default means of exchange in the context of a socio-economic system of humans, technology, economic relations, etc., do money start to have any value.</p>\n<p>If the default mode of how we interact with the world truly ready-to-hand, we have to ask how humans go about, in reality, interacting with entities that belong to such a complex web of relations. If we have to use entities practically, without pondering theoretically about their meanings, functions, etc., what cognitive powers do we use to manage the complexity of our decision making?</p>\n<p>Heidegger does provide an explanation where exactly is the totality of all assignments reduced to a single space. In chapter <em>§ 17 Reference and Signs, </em>the author writes that we do encounter the equipmental totality of references in what he calls <em>signs</em>. Signs themselves are also an equipment but their primary function is “<em>showing</em> or <em>indicating</em>” and it is “an item of equipment which explicitly raises a totality of equipment into our circumspection so that together with it the worldly character of the ready-to-hand announces itself.” (Heidegger, 2006, p. 108/78-110/80). Later on, Heidegger says that signs are produced and are deliberately made the way that is “conspicuous” or easily seen, comprehended or “accessible”. In other words, <em>signs must be deliberately designed,</em> and the work of the designer is to take the relational complexity of the web of assignments and create a door or what I consider to be an <em>interface</em> to it.</p>\n<p>The meaning and function of the sign are contextually given and depend on Dasein’s (human being) understanding of it based on its use and intelligibility (Heidegger, 1996, p. 103/82). This semantic openness of a sign suggests that the meaning is a potentiality which Dasein reduces to an actuality based on the fact that at a particular situation (context), such interpretation of the meaning is <em>sufficient</em> for whatever Dasein aims to do. What we should stress is that the interpretation occurs at <em>the moment of the interaction</em> with a sign or any entity in general. Dasein interprets the meaning of entities based on the contextual situation. How does it do that? How does it decide what is <em>sufficient</em>, and in relation to which? What Heidegger suggests is a process of hermeneutical interpretation of the world.</p>\n<h3>Cognition as hermeneutical interpretation</h3>\n<p>Hermeneutics finds its origin in the theological interpretation of Biblical texts. It deals with a question whether we can find the meaning of a text within the text itself, or whether the meaning is co-constructed by the “forces” outside the text such as the mind of a reader. The first case reminds us of Husserl and Cartesian thinking of the universal, transcendental mind being the final arbiter (everything necessary is in the mind); while the other approach takes the contextual view.</p>\n<p>Gadamer (1976) takes a third view, suggesting that the meaning is created during the act of interpretation, specifically during the interaction between the “horizon of the reader” and the “horizon of the text”. Influenced by Heidegger’s concept of Dasein, Gadamer views the human as a historically grounded being that carries its culture and history with itself in every hermeneutic situation (Gadamer, 2004, p. 301). In other words, for Dasein to be able to interpret anything, it has to possess what Levi R. Bryant calls “pre-ontological” understanding (Bryant 2017) of Being, which means all the existing knowledge, but also inherent biases, intuitive hunches. In other words, the pre-ontological understanding is filled in with cultural, social, personal influences and experiences that shape the way we approach the world. Dasein possesses this pre-ontological understanding by virtue of being-in-the-world. Heidegger and Gadamer took up the concept of hermeneutical interpretation and elevated it to the general cognitive mechanism of interacting with the world (Winograd, 1987, p. 30).</p>\n<p>The phenomenological answer to how we cope with the everyday complexity of the world is in these lines: we do not normally grasp the world theoretically, as the present-at-hand entity, but as a set of ready-to-hand, more or less phenomenologically transparent entities whereby we are surrounded. Instead, we approach the world with existing understanding, however imprecise or subjective, and are able to <em>reduce the world’s complexity</em> by interpreting it according to our aims that we want to achieve in the world. There are potentially infinite aims in the world and infinite ways to achieve them, thus making it impossible to list or represent them for a theoretical musing. It means that the world’s complexity is interpreted and reduced to something manageable by normal human beings based on our life goals. But to have life goals means that we have to <em>live</em> in the world and display a hint of care about our lives.</p>\n<h1>Surface and depth layers in HCI and anthropology</h1>\n<p>The surface and depth layers of the phenomenological reality are a problem both for HCI and anthropology. According to hermeneutical phenomenology, the default mode of how we interact with the world is by interpreting it. The interpretation is an ad hoc process that happens during the act of interacting with the world and the outcome of such interactions depends not only on the environmental side but also on the human side of the interaction. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, it is a truism to say that technology adds itself to the aforementioned interaction and strips us from the direct access to the world by functioning as a medium in-between.</p>\n<p>To understand why we behave and why we use technology in a certain way requires to go beyond the surface into the depths of a web of references that co-constitute the behaviour, meaning and the function of entities in the world, technology and human beings included. But how and what methods and techniques to study the “depth” layers are there? Even though we agree with Ingold, Bateson, post-cognitivistic theoreticians arguing that our cognition and even the mind itself is distributed across humans, environment and artefacts (Kaptelinin &amp; Nardi, 2006; Clark, 2014) and counting with the inevitable <em>hermeneutic circle</em> where we interpret the world by our knowledge of it, how can we bridge the theoretical ideas to applied research?</p>\n<p>HCI field has recently, under the umbrella of User Experience design, appropriated many anthropological and sociological methods by introducing the human-centred design approach to designing technology. Field research, personas, storytelling, quantitative analysis and qualitative interviews have made their way into the daily practice of designers. Human-centredness of the design was a great victory over a narrow obsession with the technical side of technology that was so common during the 2000s. The human-centred design gave us many answers how to study the human component in the Ingold-Bateson-Ihde’s ecological system of humans, technology, and environment.</p>\n<p>Yet, how do we study, (re-)design or evaluate large-scale sociotechnical systems such as public transport or the role of smartphones in the life of teenagers where human-computer or human-technology interactions exists on a daily basis and multi-layered scale?</p>\n<p>A design theoretician Horst Rittel and more recently Richard Buchanan (1992) call these large-scale problems <em>wicked problems</em>. They are wicked because they are systemic, holistic, intractable, avoiding full logical analysis, and without the possibility to discern where the problem starts and when it ends. Solutions to wicked problems are more in the area of suitability and appropriacy rather than true-false propositions. Political theorist Nick Srnicek (2015) argues that one of such wicked problems is economy: it is a massively distributed socio-technical system that is for most of us absolutely intangible and ephemeral, although we all share and feel the consequences of its forces. Srnicek argues, citing Fredric Jameson, that what we lack is a cognitive map of such systems, or in other words a way to represent meaningfully what the system looks like, which components it consists of and what are the relations between the components. Srnicek, therefore, calls for the need to represent to the surface layer of a system like economy before we proceed with a deeper analysis and proposing political changes.</p>\n<p>There is a new design-oriented field that set up to satisfy some of these demands. Having attended two years ago a public lecture given in Prague by academics from The Oslo University of Architecture and Design, I for the first time learned about Systems oriented design. One of the main innovations of this new design field is to approach design problems from a systems perspective, where each entity of the system (humans, technological objects) is interconnected with others, each providing and receiving functions and meanings through its membership within the larger system. Because it reminded me of what I read in Heidegger, I was curious to learn what is the actual method for mapping a system they used. It has been called GIGA-Mapping and tries to capture as many components of a system and their relationships as possible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/giga-mapping.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1206 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/giga-mapping.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/giga-mapping.png 896w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/giga-mapping-300x177.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/giga-mapping-768x453.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 2 GIGA-Mapping of a public transport system and commuting (Source: https://www.systemsorienteddesign.net/index.php/giga-mapping/100-giga-mapping)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>GIGA-mapping is clearly an interesting representational tool for capturing the structures of a given sociotechnical system. But it is static. From the hermeneutic-phenomenological point of view, it is problematic because the real and actual interactions and interpretations occur in real-time at the moment of interacting within the system. The GIGA-map thus represents only an idealistic version of the reality, abstracting and reducing the real-world complexities.</p>\n<p>If we ponder for a while, we have to realise that however we try to represent the real world for capturing its complexity, we will <em>always</em> be working with an abstraction of the reality because the only best model for the reality is the world itself. If we try in detail to describe the dynamics of a community we study anthropologically, we will also <em>always</em> provide a reduced and deformed reality.</p>\n<p>With technology being a functional necessity for our lives, sensors of the internet of things sensing and smart devices producing the enormous amount of data about our biorhythms, eating habits, working patterns or tons of likes whereby we rated our favourite online content, we could try taking advantage of the situation. The data about past, present, real-time and even future behaviour of human and technological “individuals” within a larger sociotechnical system could potentially be out there in the digital cloud. Since data can have an unlimited number of representations, the main task for exploiting the data of large sociotechnical systems is <em>to create an appropriate interface for the cognitive mapping of how the system works</em>. It is here where HCI explicitly meets anew with human sciences. In the end, Tim Ingold as a theoretician of anthropology believes that if we want to study human beings ecologically, there is no further justification for continuing separating anthropology and psychology (Ingold, 2001, p. 171).</p>\n<p>Richard Buchanan suggests that design is a suitable field for tackling wicked problems: apart from having a long tradition of synthesising complex and conflicting information, designers these days are increasingly the ones at the epicentre of our society and culture: by designing technology they also design our lives (Verbeek, 2015). Buchanan assigns design a status of a new liberal art that can say something interesting about the contemporary life (1992).</p>\n<p>Contemporary HCI and design are manifested in technological interfaces, be they graphical, tactile, voice-activated or virtual reality, as digital and technological embodiments of philosophical ideas of how we see the contemporary world. The point is to make designing interfaces open to critiquing from the seemingly outside fields that would provide a necessary check to designers and engineers how they products are influencing everyday lives of thousands or millions of people. This critique must come during the development and also after the release of a product. Our society regularly scrutinizes other techno-cultural products such as cars, fashion, art, architecture and so on. The interface should join the crowd. Moreover, it is true that the corporate sphere has appropriated anthropology and ethnography for the purposes of improving the product. But it is hazardous to leave the decisions on how technology influences our lives only to the corporate world.</p>\n<p>My idea would be to regularly conduct anthropological and ethnographic research amidst our own Western societies that are most vulnerable to unplanned, yet malicious consequences of massively used technologies. Remember what phenomenology tells us: we have to go beyond the obvious, and in many ways superficial surface layer of Being; the surface layer is a result of hidden conditions that enable the surface layer in the first place. In the context of technology, we need to research how technology manifests itself during the everyday interactions and behaviour patterns. For studying the depth layer of technology and how it shapes the current <em>human condition</em>, anthropology and ethnography seem most appropriate fields.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>References</h1>\n<p>Bateson, G.

Jsou technologické artefakty pouze externím pomocníkem k myšlení, nebo se za určitých podmínek stávají neoddělitelnou částí mysli? Může dnešní filosofie techniky a kognitivní věda informovat design vztahu člověka a technologie? Přestože fascinaci technologickým Other nacházíme již ve staré kabalistické legendě o Golemovi nebo v příběhu Frankenstein, byly tyto otázky v akademické diskurzu dlouho opomíjeny.</p>\n<p>Jacques Ellul po Marxovi upozorňoval na vliv automatizace a odcizení člověka. Technologie byla nanejvýše pouhou aplikací vědeckých poznatků a podle Karla Jasperse neutrálním instrumentem, který vykonává lidmi stanovené cíle. První zásadní zvrat nastal v díle Martina Heideggera, kde technologie získává ontologický primát nad vědou a stává se módem lidského bytí. Pro tyto a mnohé další komentátory byla však moderní technologie veskrze negativní element, se kterým se lidstvo musí vypořádat. Namísto pojetí technologie jako monolitické a dehumanizující abstraktní síly se od druhé poloviny dvacátého století začal pohled na technologii měnit.</p>\n<p>Kanadský teoretik médií Marshall McLuhan přirovnal technologii k médiu i extenzi lidských schopností, která má „osobní i sociální důsledky“ (McLuhan, 1991). S proliferací prvních počítačů se průkopníci vznikajícího oboru Human-computer interaction (HCI) shodli, že počítače nám mohou pomoci se vypořádat s narůstající komplexitou informační a síťové společnosti rozšířením „lidského intelektu“ (Bush, 1945; Licklider, 1960; Engelbart, 1962). Člověk se měl v těchto vizích stát součástí symbiotického a kybernetického vztahu s technologií (kyborgem). Tyto filosoficky a systémově orientované pohledy na kognici byly v osmdesátých letech (Card, 1983) v HCI upozaděny potom, co obor našel teoretické ukotvení v kognitivní vědě a jejím dominantním <em>kognitivistickém </em>paradigmatu. Kognitivismus vidí lidskou kognici skrze metaforu počítače jako jednotku zpracovávající informace, která operuje s interními reprezentacemi tvořených z fyzických symbolů. Kognitivistické implicitní přijetí tradice karteziánských dualismů tělo-mysl a subjekt-objekt vštípilo do samotného HCI designu i vztahu člověka s technologií předpoklad, že fyzické tělo a percepce jsou pouze periferie neboli interface mezi myslí a světem (Van Dijk, 2018). Susan Hurley takové vyobrazení kognice nazvala „sendvičové“ paradigma mysli, neboť percepce jsou pouze vstupní data do mysli a jednání je výstupní akcí z mysli do světa, zatímco kognice je “strčena” mezi nimi (Hurley, 1998; Hurley, 2008). Protože vše relevantní pro lidskou kognici se odehrává v útrobách našich hlav, technologie se pod optikou kognitivismu opět stala neutrálním instrumentem bez vlivu na naší kognici, neboť pouze pasivně vykovává úkoly zadané lidmi-uživateli. V HCI designu kognitivismus zavedl utilitární důraz na interakci s technologií, která byla strukturována dle předem připravených plánů zcela ignorující sémantické hodnoty a vliv kontextuálních sociálních a spaciotemporálních faktorů situovanosti interakce.</p>\n<p>Kognitivistické axiomy a tzv. silný program symbolické umělé inteligence kritizoval například filosof (Searle, 1980). Známý HCI teoretik Don Norman, napsal, že pro studium kognici je třeba jednání člověka studovat ze systémového pohledu, ve kterém situace, sociální a kulturní vlivy spolu interagují zpětnovazebními mechanismy (Norman, 1980). Filosof Hubert Dreyfus pomocí Heideggerovy fenomenologie, pozdního díla Wittgensteina a Merleau-Pontyho Dreyfus argumentoval, že model člověka symbolického procesu abstrahovaný ze světa nepovede k inteligentnímu jednání, neboť člověk a jeho kognice jsou fundamentálně <em>vtělené </em>ve-světě, kdy svět slouží jako externí reprezentace sebe sama a významy věcí a nástrojů v Heideggerově analýze prostředků jsou ukotveny v „síti signifikace“. (Heidegger, 1996, §15 69/89). Pouze skrze vztahy k dalším prostředkům a kontextu praxe jeho použití získává daný nástroj svůj význam (Kiverstein, 2012, s. 4). Dreyfusovo uvedení fenomenologie a principu vtělenosti do kognitivní vědy měl zásadní dopad na výzkum HCI a umělé inteligence. Přímo inspiroval Terryho Winograda (Winograd, 1987) nebo antropoložku Lucy Suchman (Suchman, 1985; Clark a Chalmers, 1998), která empirickým výzkumem ukázala, že lidé nejednají na základě strukturovaných a priori plánů, nýbrž jednají <em>ad hoc</em> v reálném čase na konkrétní <em>situaci </em>a využívají zdrojů, které mají po ruce, čímž pomohla nastartovat výzkumný program <em>situované akce/kognice</em>. Rodney Brooks v klasickém článku (Brooks, 1991) souhlasil, že svět je svým nejlepším modelem a byl jeden z prvních, kteří v robotice implementovali myšlenky „Heideggeriánské UI“ nepoužívající interní reprezentace. Vtělenost kognice, tedy teze, že tělo netriviálně formuje naše myšlení, dále prozkoumali například (Lakoff a Johnson, 1980). Pokud přijmeme argument, že tělo hraje důležitou roli v naší kognici, proč se omezovat hranicemi naší kůže?</p>\n<p>Jednou z odpovědí na tuto otázku byly teze distribuované (Hutchins, 1995) a rozšířené kognice (Clark, 1997; Clark a Chalmers, 1998; Clark, 2004). Argumentují, že vyšší kognitivní procesy jsou produkovány aplikací nižších kognitivních procesů na použití kulturních materiálů v podobě jazyka, znakových systémů či technologických artefaktů (Hutchins, 2010; Norman, 1993; Vygotsky, 1975; Clark, 2001). Andy Clark, hlavní představitel teorie rozšířené kognice zastává pozici <em>aktivního externalismu</em>, v jehož případě je lidský organismus tvoří s externí entitou prostřednictvím obousměrné interakce propojený (coupled) kognitivní systém, který je nutné chápat jako jeden celek. Externí procesy jsou stejně kauzálně relevantní jako interní části mozku. Podle Clarka mysl „prosakuje“ do prostředí, a proto jsme <em>přirozenými kyborgy</em>: kybernetickým organismem, ve kterém biologické, technologické a environmentální komponenty dávají vzniknout emergentním schopnostem a jednání.</p>\n<p>Historie i současnost teorie rozšířené kognice je tedy komplexní. David Chalmers (Clark, 2004, předmluva) i český teoretik Roman Madzia (Madzia, 2013) poukazují na to, že zárodečné myšlení teorie rozšířené kognice najdeme již u představitelů filosofie amerického pragmatismu Herberta Meada a Johna Deweyho. Novomediální teorie (např. Manovich, 2002; Dvořák, 2010; Wark, 2016), HCI (Kaptelinin a Nardi, 2006; Turner, 2016), antropologie (Haraway, 1987) i sociologie vědy navazující na dílo Bruno Latoura vykazují tradici analýzy vztahu člověka a mediální technologie, které přímo vychází nebo jsou komplementární k teorii rozšířené kognice. Historická analýza tématu se v neposlední řadě musí zároveň vypořádat s odlišnostmi a sdílenými předpoklady přímo uvnitř kognitivní vědy, neboť teorie rozšíření kognice sdílí zájem vědců s dalšími paralelními výzkumnými programy Embodied, Embedded a Enactive kognice, jež jsou označované zastřešujícím pojmem 4E kognitivní vědy (Kiverstein, 2018).</p>\n<p>Protože teorie rozšířené kognice je radikálně anti-karteziánská a propojuje tělo, mysl a prostředí, nabízí se její explicitní uvedení do filosofie techniky prostřednictvím syntézy novomediální teorie a současné postfenomenologické filosofie techniky (Ihde, 1978; Ihde, 1990; Verbeek, 2005; Verbeek a Rosenberger, 2015; Verbeek, 2015). Její představitelé analyzují technologii jako multistabilní a anti-esencialistické médium, které amplifikuje a redukuje naše percepce, čímž vytváří specifický vztah ke světu.</p>\n<p>Tato syntéza nabízí několik bodů zkoumání. Zaprvé představuje argument pro ontologickou analýzu nefixní, multistabilní povahy člověka a technologických objektů, jež se definuje teprve při vzájemné interakci. Zadruhé by bylo možné prozkoumat, jakým způsobem užíváme „kognitivní technologie“ k odkládání (off-load) náročných činností z mozku na externí artefakty (Clark, 2002; Dennet, 1996, s. 134-135). V neposlední by bylo vhodné se zaměřit na to, jakým způsobem použití technologie zprostředkovává (mediuje) a transformuje náš přístup ke světu. Jednou z implikací takové syntézy pro obory HCI a designu technologie v technologicky mediovaném světě by mohlo být, že design technologie je ekvivalentní k designu vztahu mezi člověkem, přírodou a sociálním světem, ale také designu lidských kognitivních schopností.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Zdroje k zadání projektu</h2>\n<p>BROOKS, Rodney A., 1991.

Nejdříve vystoupil v americkém kongresu, nyní odcestoval do Bruselu, aby v Evropské parlamentu před zraky statisíců, možná miliónů svých uživatelů vysvětlil evropským činitelům problémy, se kterými se Facebook potýká. Konkrétně se opět hovořilo o tom, jak mohlo dojít k masivnímu úniku osobních informací uživatelů v rámci aféry Cambridge Analytica a jejich údajného politicky motivovaného zneužití ze strany některých ruských aktérů.</p>\n<p>Během 80 minutového výslechu jsme mohli slyšet kontroverzního britského politika Nigela Farage, který deklaroval, že bez platformy Facebooku by Brexit nebo zvolení Donalda Trumpa nebylo možné. Mě však zaujalo vystoupení belgického politika Guye Verhofstadta a jeho rétorické kvality. Představitel aliance liberálů a demokratů pro Evropu se Zuckerberga zeptal, zdali bude chtít, aby se na jeho dědictví pamatovalo &#8222;jako na jednoho ze tří internetových velikánů, společně se Stevem Jobsem a Billem Gatese, kteří obohatili náš svět a společnost&#8220; nebo &#8222;jako na génia, jenž vytvořil digitální monstrum, které ničí naší demokracii a společnost?&#8220; Verhofstadt dále Zuckerbergovi položil otázku, zdali bude schopný Facebook spravit. Nehledě na to, co si možná Zuckerberg přeje a politická garnitura nařizuje, mým názorem je, že při současné velikosti Facebook ani na čistě teoretické rovině nelze &#8222;spravit&#8220;.</p>\n<p>Svůj názor zakladám na poznatcích současného teoretického myšlení o technologii v postfenomenologickém proudu oboru filozofie techniky a teorie rozšíření kognice v oboru kognitivní vědy. Oba pohledy se velmi blízce zaobírají typy interakcí s technologií i tím, jakou povahu má obecně vztah člověka s technologií.</p>\n<p>Standardní příběh pod vlivem Karla Jasperse i dalších donedávna vyprávěl, že technologie je neutrální instrument, zatímco člověk sám je oním prvkem, který technologii vdechne život a funkcionality. Technologie je tedy pasivním objektem a člověk aktivním aktérem. Tento pohled na technologii následuje, často nevědomě, historickou pozici, kterou jsme zdědili ze 17. století od francouzského filozofa René Descartese, jenž rád odděloval tělo od mysli i tzv. subjekt od objektu. Pod pláštíkem karteziánského myšlení člověk přichází do kontaktu s technologií tak, že obě strany této interakce mají předem pevně stanovené vlastnosti i cíle, zcela nezávislé na kontextuálních, kulturních nebo společenských faktorech dané situace, ve které interakce probíhá. Nebylo překvapením, že takový pohled na technologii existoval. V návaznosti na karteziánské učení byl člověk pod vlivem tzv. kognitivistického dogmatu sám viděn jako stroj, snad o něco pomalejší počítač, pro který tělo a percepce jsou užitečné jen jako vstupní data nebo výstup nějakého jednání. Susan Hurley takové vyobrazení člověka nazvala “sandwichové” paradigma mysli, neboť percepce jsou pouze vstupní data do mysli a jednání je výstupní akcí z mysli do světa, zatímco kognice je “strčena” doprostřed mezi nimi. Vše relevantní pro lidskou mysl i používání technologie se údajně odehrává v útrobách našich hlav, stačí jen následovat předem stanovený plán.</p>\n<p>Tuto karikaturu člověka a jeho vztahu k technologii samozřejmě napadlo hned několik teoretiček a teoretiků. Mezi nimi filozof John Searle se svým myšlenkovým experimentem Čínského pokoje nebo antropoložka Lucy Suchmanová, která ve své práci, ovlivněna fenomenologickou filozofií, zjistila zcela odlišný pohled na člověka. Místo toho, aby člověk jednal podle předem strukturovaných plánů, Suchmanová úspěšně ukázala na experimentu s komplikovanou fotokopírkou, že lidé jednají <em>ad hoc</em> v reálném čase na konkrétní situaci a využívají zdrojů, které mají po ruce, čímž pomohla nastartovat výzkumný program situované akce/kognice.</p>\n<p>Dvojice filozofů Andy Clark a David Chalmers v roce 1998 pak vydali průlomový článek <em>Extended Mind Thesis</em>, ve kterém poukázali na to, že místo metafory počítače bychom se měli dívat na člověka jako na přirozeného kyborga. Clark a Chalmers svou teorií rozšířené mysli/kognice tvrdí na příkladu člověka trpícího Alzheimerovou chorobou, že poznámkový blok nebo iPhone mohou netriviálně sloužit jako reálná náhražka naší paměti. Pokud artefakt vykonává funkci, kterou bychom jinak, pokud by se odehrávala v hlavě, označili za součást mysli, je tento artefakt reálně naší mysli součástí. Tímto principem &#8222;parity&#8220; jednoduše říkají, že kromě dispozic fyzického těla je naše myšlení ovlivněno i artefakty a prostředím, neboť není důvod privilegovat pouze to, co je v útrobách našich hlav, jako jediné, co tvoří naší mysl.</p>\n<p>Teorie rozšířené mysli patří společně s teoriemi vtělené, vnořené a situované kognice momentálně k z nejžhavějším tématům v současné kognitivní vědě. Idea, že by technologie mohla zásadně ovlivňovat, ba dokonce konstituovat naší mysli, ale není nová. Sovětský psycholog Lev Vygotsky, kybernetické teorie, Marshall McLuhan či počítačoví průkopníci Vannevar Bush či Douglas Engelbart všichni tvrdili, že technologie do určité míry má důležitý vliv na naše myšlení. Avšak nikdy nebyla tato vize člověka jako přirozeného kyborga tak veřejně přijmuta (i když kritika existuje) jako v současné kognitivní vědě.</p>\n<p>Z lehce jiného úhlu pohledu hovoří o našem vztahu k technologii nizozemský filozof techniky Peter-Paul Veerbek či fyzička a feministka Karen Baradová.</p>\n<p>Veerbek navazuje na svého amerického mentora Dona Ihdeho radikálním ontologickým tvrzením, že člověk ani technologie nejsou entity, které by měly pevně stanovené vlastnosti. Je to právě až <em>interakce</em> mezi nimi, která nejdříve mění a poté vykrystalizuje konkrétní povahu člověka a technologických artefaktů. Veerbek navazuje na fenomenologii Martina Heideggera, který ve svém magnum opus <em>Bytí a čas</em> psal, že technologie získává svůj význam <em>i funkce</em> ve vztahu k ostatní technologii, ale i ke konkrétní situaci, jakým způsobem je použita. Neznamená to, že by technologie byla zcela amorfní a kontextuálně kontruovaným objektem. Má samozřejmě i své fyzické vlastností, které dělají určité <em>afordance</em>, tedy poskytované možnosti použití, pravděpodobnější nežli jiné. Avšak zcela obyčejná PET láhev může mít kontejnerem na tekutinu, ale také květináčem a symbolem udržitelného zahradničení. Pokud láhev může takto metamorfózovat v závislosti na kontextu, co potom digitální platforma typu Facebooku?</p>\n<p>Karen Baradová nabízí filozoficky o něco ambiciónější projekt, přesto velmi podobný práci Veerbeka. Baradová zavádí neologismus <em>intra-akce</em>, kterým poukazuje na přirozenou provázanost všech entit, nejen technologie a člověka, jejichž identita se vynořuje v průběhu intra-akce s dalšími entitami.</p>\n<p>Všechny stručně nastíněné teorie současné filozofie techniky a kognitivní vědy mají společné to, že člověka na kognitivní i ontologické úrovni vidí tak, že je součástí kybernetického, bio-technologického organismu. Takový popis není pouze metaforický, ale zcela reálný. Proto si Andy Clark může dovolit říct, <a href=\"https://www.edge.org/conversation/natural-born-cyborgs\">že jsme <em>přirozenými</em> kyborgy</a>.</p>\n<p>Vraťme se po tomto teoretickém bloku zpět k aféře Facebooku. Slibovat odstranění problémů Facebooku a ujištění Amerického kongresu a Evropského parlamentu, že se již podobné excesy nebudou opakovat, je sisyfovská práce. Pokud by Facebook byla začínající sociální síť, která má několik stovek uživatelů, její sociální rozměr by byl minimální a Zuckerbergův optimismus, že lze toto &#8222;digitální monstrum&#8220; zkrotit legislativně nebo inženýrsky, by byl realistický. Avšak problém Facebooku nejsou ruští hackeři, ale fakt, že je až příliš velký a oblíbený. Facebook redefinuje naše kognitivní i sociální vlastnosti, neboť se stal neoddělitelnou součástí našich životů. Myslím, že ještě nikdy jsme neměli srovnatelně rozšířenou technologii, kterou nejen používá většina planety, nýbrž ovlivňuje hned několik rovin současné společnosti. Elektřina, internet nebo Web se zdají být dalšími vhodnými kandidáty na tento post, ale jejich pravou silou bylo to, že nabídly kreativním inženýrům a designérům potenciální platformu pro vytvoření i něčeho dokonce vlivnějšího: outsourcingu naší socializace do digitálního Simulakra.</p>\n<p>Právě enormní úspěch Zuckerbergovy sociální sítě znamená, že jako součást bio-technologické symbiózy s člověkem je Facebook vystaven novým a novým možnostem, jak může být využíván, ale i zneužíván. Tento problém se bude pouze násobit, pokud Facebook má ambice přidávat nové funkce opět radikálně měnící naši mysl a společnost. Ať už si myslí ti nejlepší inženýři ve Facebooku cokoli, nikdy nebudou schopni do svého produktu implementovat tak restriktivní protokoly, díky kterým by měli své monstrum pod kontrolou.</p>\n<p>Verhofstadt má pravdu v tom, že Facebook se omlouvá uživatelům od počátku. Problémy Facebooku již dávnou nejsou v technické oblasti, a tak tradiční inženýrské postupy pro řešení problémů selhávají. A i když by jistě neuškodilo, kdyby Facebook nabral více sociologů a filozofů, při své velikosti je příliš svázán se společností a společnost s ním. Problémem totiž není to, že by inženýři nevěděli lék na danou nemoc, ale fakt, že o nemoci do poslední chvíle nevědí, aby se mohli na ní připravit. Snad jedinou možností by bylo drasticky snížit funkcionality platformy. Případně veškeré funkcionality vypnout a postupně se uživatele opt-in formou ptát, aby si danou funkci zapnul. Ale to není pravděpodobný scénář byznys strategie této korporace.</p>\n<p>Facebook zatím využili teroristé pro nábor a šíření propagandy, údajní ruští trolové a agentury za účelem dosazení Donalda Trumpa do Bílého domu a v neposlední řadě všichni developeři třetích stran si mohli uchovávat více informací o uživatelích, než by měli.</p>\n<p>Možná na poslední chvíli Facebook zachrání deus ex machina v podobě vševědoucí a vševidoucí Umělé inteligence. Do té doby jim nezbývá nic jiného než se zaťatými zuby čekat, jestli se neobjeví další skandál.

Existuje mnoho postupů, které designéři mohou aplikovat k dosáhnutí tohoto cíle. Po hlubší analýze tohoto problému se nabízí jeden proces, který by mohl být kandidátem na univerzální mechanismus toho, proč je technologie, která redukuje komplexitu, tak účinná. Tím mechanismem je zvyšující se <em>abstrakce</em>, která více a více odtělesňuje a distancuje složitost za účelem, aby našemu intelektu poskytla interface k asembláži mnohosti relací a materiálních těles. Nazvěme tento proces abstrakce <em>transdukcí</em> jako poklonu dvěma velikánům francouzského filosofického myšlení: René Descartovi a Gilbertu Simondonovi. Pro připomenutí Descartes <em>transdukcí</em> myslel proces vykonávaný šišinkou mozkovou (pineal gland), která propojovala tělo a mysl, zatímco Simondon <em>transdukcí</em> označoval ve své ontologii proces individuace směřující k meta stabilnímu individuu, které se vynořuje z hlubin neoddělené virtuální vrstvy reality obsahující potenciál k aktualitě.</p>\n<p>Nejjednodušší způsob, jak si představit koncept technologie jako redukce a abstrahování komplexity je například rozdělání ohně a programování.</p>\n<p>Pokud si pračlověk chtěl ohřát svou masitou kořist, aby lépe chutnala a také ohřátím odstranil bakterie, potřeboval rozdělat oheň. Nejdříve čekal na přírodu, až uhodí blesk. Poté se naučil uchovávat přírodou rozdělaný oheň. Po nějaké době se jej naučil rozdělávat sám. Dále do přítomnosti jsme popsali chemickou reakci stojící za ohněm. V neposlední řadě jsme zjistili, že rozkmitání H20 molekul pomocí mikrovln vede jako vedlejší efekt k produkci tepla a ohřátí oběda. Jedno tlačítko na mikrovlnné troubě je interface do komplikovaných útrob trouby. Není potřeba znát fyzikální zákony nebo vynakládat fyzickou sílu k rozdělání ohně. Ohřátí jídla se skrze technologii stalo teoreticko-verbálním úkonem uchovat ve verbální paměti sémiotický symbol a jeho přidruženou funkci.</p>\n<p>Turingova teze Univerzálního stroje, který při jednoduchých mechanismech by měl komputačními procesy &#8222;spočítat&#8220; vše, co lze formalizovat do řetězce nějakých symbolů, předznamenala možnost oddělit úzké propojení hardwaru a softwaru. Pro první eletrické a později i digitálního počítače ale bylo zatím jejich fungování úzce spjato s kompozicí jeho fyzických komponent. Na začátku programování obsahovalo dvě distinktní části. První část byla analyticko-matematická, během které bylo na teoretické úrovně potřeba vymyslet, jakým způsobem tu ohromnou mašinerii rozprostírající se přes několik místností uvést do pohybu. Jakmile tato teoretická část byla hotova, bylo nutné teorii <em>implementovat</em> do fyzické reality počítače prostřednictvím přepojování spojů. Toto přepojování spojů znamenalo důsledně následovat teorii, rozpomenout se, kde se jednotlivé spoje nachází a propojit kabely dle požadavků. Tento kognitivní úkon se velmi podobá zapamatování si sémiotického symbolu (pozice, označení kabelu) a jeho přidruženou funkci.</p>\n<p>Byla to žena, programátorka Kathleen Booth, která navrhla první abstraktní vrstvu nad fyzickou implementací kódu &#8211; assemblage jazyk -, který umožňoval komunikovat s počítačem pomocí primitivních, ale stále mocných operací přesunů obsahu paměti z jedné do druhé, skoků, podmínek apod. Další žena, Grace Hopper, povýšila komunikaci s počítačem na něco, co se skutečně komunikaci blížilo. Navrhla první programovací jazyk COBOL, tak populární ve velkých korporátních kruzích, neboť jakožto relativně deklarativní jazyk abstrahoval komplexitu implementace algoritmů a nyní bylo důležitější přemýšlet nad tím, co má počítač dělat, spíše než jak to udělat. Deklarativní filosofie programovacích jazyků s příchodem jazyka C byla upozaděna na úkor <em>imperativních</em> jazyků, kde bylo nutné každý krok počítače relativně podrobně popsat, avšak tento vyšší programovací jazyk už těžil ze své abstrakce, dokonce vyšší než assembler jazyky.</p>\n<p>Vyšší programovací jazyky následoval vznik <em>textového interface</em> příkazové řádky a klávesnice jako vstupního zařízení. Možná poprvé zde můžeme hovořit o <em>interakci</em> s počítačem, neboť počítače v nekonečné smyčce zpětné vazby reagovaly na příkazy, které uživatel zadal. Tento koncept zpětné vazby byl použit i v prvním grafickém interface. Nyní vnitřní mašinerii počítače, například změnu obsahu operační paměti, bylo možné uvést do pohybu pouhým kliknutím na tlačítko. Správa technologické asembláže se redukovala na správu dvourozměrného vizuálního prostoru. Programovací jazyky samozřejmě nevymřely a v mnoha případech jsou stále nejlepším způsobem, jak komunikovat s počítačem a přinutit ho k činnostem, které požadujeme. Avšak vyšší a vyšší programovací jazyky, včetně návratu deklarativní formy programování, znamenají monumentální evoluci v tom, jakým způsobem interagujeme nejen s počítačem, ale s celou asembláží počítačů, sítí, internetu věcí a v neposlední řadě mnoha částí našich technologicky mediovaných životů. To vše je nyní schované ve většině případů za tlačítky a s růstající tendencí začínáme s počítačem skutečně <em>komunikovat</em>, tak jako to bylo kdysi snem v populárních science fiction příbězích. Digitální pomocnice jako Siri či Cortana (všimněme si genderu) jsou nyní jedním z nejpřirozenějších forem interakce: verbální komunikací.</p>\n<p>Na jedné straně si představme technologickou mašinerii, všechny ty materiální objekty, sítě, spoje, které někdo musel navrhnout a postavit. Na druhé straně máme nás jako uživatele. Tyto dvě strany spolu komunikují skrze <em>interface</em>, který koná funkci překladu, neboli <em>transdukce</em>, kdy dvě nekompatibilní strany jsou schopné spolu komunikovat. Interface jakožto co nejobecněji pojatý prostředník, proces i entita, to, co jest v liminálním prostoru <em>mezi</em>, vyrovnává, smazává, propojuje a koriguje jejich nekompatibility. Interface tímto způsobem je procesem transdukce (překladu). Člověku i neživé entitě poskytuje dvě základní funkcionality: <em>redukci</em> komplexity a <em>rozšíření</em> schopností. Paradoxně redukce komplexity se zdá minimálně pro člověka jako prerekvizita rozšíření schopností.</p>\n<p>Jako hypotetickou rovnici interface můžeme napsat následující: <em>interface = redukce komplexity = transdukce = rozšíření schopností</em></p>\n<p>Jelikož ona redukce komplexity a rozšíření schopností se děje skrze interface, mohli bychom možná jednoduše říct, že interface je <em>médium</em> v mcluhanovském smyslu, jakožto entita-proces, jejíž základní povahou je neustálá interakce s ostatními entitami a překlad mezi nimi.</p>\n<p>Přestože Mcluhan hovořil o rozšíření naší mysl jako jednoho z efektů média, nebyl jsem prozatím schopný z jeho díla rozpoznat příklon k tomu, že neméně důležitou funkcí média, a tím pádem i interface, je redukce komplexity, která možná není separátní funkcí interface, nýbrž druhá strana stejné mince.</p>\n<p>A možná nikoli, možná extenze a redukce pomocí interface jsou na sobě dvě nezávislé strategie. A proto by si zasloužily samostatné pojmenování. Pro nedostatek invence si myslím, že prozatím postačí pojmy <em>interfaciální extenze</em> a <em>interfaciální redukce</em>.</p>\n<p>Právě interfaciální extenze a interfaciální redukce jsou podle mého úspěšnými strategiemi Západního světa. Nesou si sebou ale i své problémy. Již McLuhan říkal, že západní svět je příliš orientován na to, co pojmenoval &#8222;figure&#8220;, tedy povrch věcí na úkor, na úkor &#8222;ground&#8220;, hloubky či pozadí věcí a pro McLuhana především médií. Toto pozadí média je onou formou, kdežto obsah média je triviální a pro McLuhanovu analýzu nepodstatným &#8222;povrchem&#8220; médií. McLuhan diagnostikoval problém moderní, na technologii závislé společnosti.</p>\n<p>Mým názorem je, že použití technologie (kterou McLuhan používal synonymně s médii) nevyhnutelně vede ke strategiím interfaciální redukce a interfaciální extenze. Používáme technologii proto, abychom se již nemuseli zabývat komplikovaností určitých věcí nebo procesů. Proto vytváříme interface, který tuto komplexitu skrývá a poskytuje nám jen v našich očích <em>relevantní</em> funkce a mechanismy.</p>\n<p>Dříve nebo později však zapomeneme na to, že interface je pouze (re)prezentací něčeho, co existuje separátně od interface samotného. Čeho je ale interface (re)prezentací? Něčeho, co doposud neexistovalo, je to pomyslné zarámování určité technologické komplexity světa, interface je ve všech svých formách syntetickým mentálním obrazem, nebo spíše kognitivní mapou toho, jakým způsobem přemýšlíme o světě. I proto spíše než entitou, věcí, objektem se interface jeví jako vztah mezi člověkem a světem. Vztah, který ale doposud neexistoval, což z tvorby interface dělá kreativní akt <em>par excellence</em>, neboť pod svými křídly syntetizuje svět materie i svět idejí a na základě určité ideologie vytváří nový vztah k technologii, a skrze ní i ke světu.</p>\n<p>Interface nám umožňuje čím dál více manipulovat náš fyzický svět pomocí slova. Jednoho dne interfaciální redukce a interfaciální extenze dosáhnou takové úrovně abstrakce, že někomu z nás postačí říct: &#8222;budiž světlo&#8220;.</p>\n<p>Než taková doba nastane, predikuji, že končí éra dominance matematicko-logického myšlení a nastává opět privilegované období Slova, verbální inteligence. Neznamená to, že formální jazyky jako matematika nebudou třeba, avšak stanou se ve většině případů technickou stránkou metody, jak objevovat nové interface. Designéři poté tento technický potenciál převezmou a vytvoří reálný interface, který umožní jim samotným, ale i netechnicky orientované, ale verbálně nadané části společnosti užít interface pro ovládání větší a větší části sociotechnické asembláže, kterou Benjamin Bratton nazývá The Stack.</p>\n<p>Do Stacku patří i kultura a společnost a strategie interfaciální redukce může mít na ně negativní vliv. Ona redukce je totiž vždy ztrátovou kompresí. To znamená, že pouze ze samotného interface není možné zpětně reverzním inženýrstvím získat celou komplexitu. Pokud si nedáme tu práci ale co nejvíce zpětně dohledat onu původní komplexitu skrývající se za interface, více a více se realita bude tvořit pouze pomocí interface. Bude se zjednodušovat, pokřivovat a bude těžší a těžší i pro jinak velmi inteligentní lidi mluvit nebo psát o reálné komplexitě světa, neboť si na pohodlí interfaciální redukce příliš navyknou.</p>\n<p>Pokud se nepletu, interface vytváří vlastní ideologii, která se více a více deformuje směrem dovnitř, čímž se pomyslně z ní ždímají jen esenciální elementy, její stavební bloky. Z komplexního a organicky propojeného světa se stane univerzum jakoby se do sebe hroutících interfaců-černých děr. Ideologie se stanou jednodušší a snáze odlišitelných od ostatních. Je možné, že to povede k velmi silně polarizované společnosti, která se z holisticky organického celku rozpadne na hermeticky separované kruhy, sociální bubliny?</p>\n<p>Platíme intelektuální a společenskou daň za to, že jsme uživateli technologie a strategií interfaciální redukce a extenze, které nás uvádějí do schizoidního stavu, kdy jsme na jednu stranu schopni mnohem více, ale stáváme se hloupější, podobně jako vysokoškolák, který v prvním ročníku sleduje mnoho YouTube videí a myslí si, že kvantita toho, co viděl, z něho dělá vzdělanějšího a hlubšího myslitele než je jeho profesor?</p>\n<p>Možná měl McLuhan pravdu. Verbální inteligence je příliš povrchní, příliš interfaciální. Slova jsou taktéž interface, neboť holistickou realitu dělí na diskrétní (digitální) kusy. Možná naše zaslepenost a neporozumění toho, že pojmenování se nerovná reálná komplexita reality nás svedla z cesty. I když Západní společnosti verbální inteligence mnohé přinesla, odvrátila nás od holistického pojetí světa, tak běžných v jiných společenstvích, například v mnoha afrických státech a v neposlední řadě i zbývajících domorodých tradicích.</p>\n<p>Na počátku sice bylo Slovo, ale před ním byla Inteligence. Zaměňovat tyto dvě věci není moudré.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>(source: http://www.krislouie.com/mcluhan/nlcst3z3twcg2uiezd1ckyvw4ily91) Nejdůležitější role technologie je její schopnost redukovat složitost našich životů.

Mnoho z nich je napsáno designovými profesionály oboru s mnohaletou praktickou zkušeností na velkých projektech. Je vhodné sledovat, co tito lidé mají říct, protože praktické zkušenosti zůstávají důležitou formou poznání a znalosti pro jakéhokoliv designéra. Otázkou tak zní, proč byste měli číst a poslouchat teoretické poznámky k tak praktickému oboru jako je UX design?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moje odpověď je dobře známá, ale přesto ji zopakuji prostřednictvím známého hesla ze série Star trek: abychom odvážně mohli jít tam, kam se dosud nikdo nevydal, je nezbytné se občas zastavit a podívat se, co jsme zkusili, co jsme otestovali, co funguje a proč. Jinými slovy, v našem případě to znamená se zamyslet, proč děláme UX takovým způsobem, kterým jej děláme. Nevím, jestli jste jako já, ale pokud se něčemu věnuji, mám tendenci vždy vědět o nejnovějším vývoji daného oboru. Není nad dobrý pocit si přečíst každé ráno nejnovější článek a dozvědět se něco nového. Tento dobrý pocit ale netrvá dlouho. Dalo by se říct, že je to pouze jedna dávka drogy jménem informační zahlcení. Když nečtu každý den nové blogposty, mám pocit, že o něco důležitého přicházím. Nebo aspoň dříve jsem tento pocit míval. Před více než půl rokem se mi totiž naskytla možnost číst během těchto šesti měsíců mnoho historické a teoretické literatury na téma UX a HCI, což mi poskytlo mnoho odpovědí, ale přiznám se, i mnoho nových otázek. Co jsem si na této cestě ale uvědomil je, že UX a obecněji obor HCI, tedy obor studující interakci mezi člověkem a počítačem, jsou obory, které samy o sobě představují pomyslné i reálné rozhraní (interface) mezi designem, kognitivní vědou, filozofií, kulturou a společností. Podle mého názoru jsou to jedny z nejzajímavějších oborů, které dnes v informační společnosti naplněné internetem věcí a všudypřítomnou technologií lze studovat. A to nejen proto, že jsou teoreticky zajímavé, ale jejich hlubší studium nabízí pohled na vztah člověka a technologie a také vysvětlení, proč je UX tak důležité a proč nabízí potenciál pro sociální i byznys inovace.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Místo definice, historie HCI jako současnost UX</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Není náhodou, že na webech jako Quora je jednou z nejčastějších otázek, jak se UX liší od UI, UX nebo interakčního designu. Mnoho otázek se zabývá tím, co je to UX design a volá po nějaké definici. Mezi běžné a více či méně sofistikované odpovědi patří například:</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1119\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-01.png\" alt=\"def-01.png\" width=\"1152\" height=\"648\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-01.png 1152w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-01-300x169.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-01-768x432.png 768w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-01-1024x576.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1115\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-02.png\" alt=\"def-02\" width=\"1152\" height=\"648\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-02.png 1152w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-02-300x169.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-02-768x432.png 768w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-02-1024x576.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px\" /><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1117\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-04.png\" alt=\"def-04\" width=\"1152\" height=\"648\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-04.png 1152w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-04-300x169.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-04-768x432.png 768w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-04-1024x576.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px\" /><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1116\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-03.png\" alt=\"def-03\" width=\"1152\" height=\"648\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-03.png 1152w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-03-300x169.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-03-768x432.png 768w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-03-1024x576.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px\" /><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1118\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-05.png\" alt=\"def-05\" width=\"1152\" height=\"653\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-05.png 1152w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-05-300x170.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-05-768x435.png 768w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/def-05-1024x580.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jak jistě víte, byl to Don Norman, který během svého působení na pozici usability architekta ve firmě Apple, zavedl v moderním smyslu termín “user experience design”. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don Norman komentuje použití tohoto pojmu: </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">„Termín jsem vymyslel, protože jsem považoval HCI a použitelnost za příliš omezující: chtěl jsem pokrýt všechny aspekty lidského prožívání se systémem, včetně průmyslového designu, grafiky, interface, fyzické interakce a manuálu. Od té doby se termín tak rozšířil, že začíná ztrácet svůj význam.“</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Přestože tyto definice považuji za důležitá vodítka, rád bych se dnes na UX podíval trochu odlišně. Veškeré zmíněné definice totiž trpí stejným neduhem: snaží se zachytit UX design v jeho současné podobě, tak jak se nám jeví teď a tady. Což je legitimní způsob. Já se ovšem rád dívám na evoluční trajektorii věcí, jak se vyvíjí v čase. Pro UX to znamená podívat se krátce na historické proudy v oborech jako HCI, ze kterých se UX přímo nebo nepřímo vyvinulo a objevilo na scéně. Což nám také dává možnost porovnat, jestli UX design dnes naplňuje motivace a očekávání do něj vložená.</p>\n<h2>Lidské faktory a ergonomie</h2>\n<p>Aniž bych šel příliš hluboko do historie, je zajímavé říct, že i v případě HCI nebo UX nebylo výjimkou, že nejvíce inovací proběhlo ve válečném období. Během Druhé světové války výzkumníci řešili, proč piloti letadel, s dobrým výcvikem a bez mechanických poruch, havarují bez zjevné příčiny. Ukázalo se, že to, co bychom dnes nazvali user interface palubní desky, její tlačítka a páčky, nebyly zrovna vzorem dobrého designu a ergonomie. I proto se objevily nové obory jako lidské faktory, ergonomika nebo inženýrská psychologie, které měly pomoct navrhnout jednodušší a pro lidské tělo přijatelnější ovládaní letadel. O pár let později, v letech 1952 a 1957 vznikly profesionální asociace jako Ergonomic Society nebo její americká verze Human Factors Society, čímž se stvrdila důležitost a poptávka po těchto oborech.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1120\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/human_factors.png\" alt=\"human_factors.png\" width=\"1152\" height=\"713\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/human_factors.png 1152w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/human_factors-300x186.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/human_factors-768x475.png 768w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/human_factors-1024x634.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px\" /><br />\nInterface a jeho design se v této době zaměřoval na to, jak využít znalostí o fyzických omezeních lidského těla k navržení vhodných mechanických ovládacích prvků.</p>\n<h2>Inovace v IT a vznik GUI a interface</h2>\n<p>Přeskočme skoro jednu dekádu do roku 1963, kdy Ivan Sutherland ve své dizertační práci inspirované Vannevarem Bushem a jeho Memexem, představil první interaktivní grafický software s názvem Sketchpad. Je možné říct, že se jedná o první počítačový grafický interface.<br />\nPozději v legendární firmě Xerox PARC, Douglas Engelbart vytvořil grafický uživatelský interface postavený na metafoře pracovního stolu. Zde se právě narodil grafický tzv. “desktop interface”. I díky firmě NeXT, Apple a Stevu Jobsovi, který Xerox v té době navštívil a byl ohromen GUI, přetrvává metafora desktopu v relativně nezměněné podobě dodnes</p>\n<p>Společnost začala být zaplavována těmito osobními počítači. Mnoho miliónů lidí se začalo spoléhat na interface jako na okno k funkcionalitám a neviditelnému technickému potenciálu počítačů. Ty začaly řešit pracovní a později i každodenní lidské potřeby. Najednou design počítačů, jejich interfaců a interakce mezi počítačem a člověkem začaly být čím dál více důležitými.</p>\n<p>Designéři proto potřebovali pevný základ, na kterém by mohli navrhovat interface. Protože obory ergonomie a lidských faktorů byly a-teoretické, tedy nevěnovaly se teorii návrhu interface, ale soustředily se především na pragmatické řešení.</p>\n<p>Bannon (Bannon, 1995) řekl, že odborníci často přicházeli do lidských faktorů a ergonomiky se vzděláním v behaviorální vědě nebo průmyslovém inženýrství a zpětně se jejich snažení vytýkala nedostatečná orientace na generování teoretických znalostí, což oborům vyneslo pejorativní označení psychologie „tlačítek a číselníků“. Dnes bychom možná řekli, že některé přístupy v HCI, UX a designu interface nejsou nic jiného než design „tlačítek a skrolbarů“.</p>\n<p>Kolem osmdesátých let si designéři a výzkumníci interface uvědomili, že dřívější pohled na vztah člověka a člověka byl už zastaralý. Když se počítače rozšířily do pracovního sektoru, bylo zřejmé, že práce s počítačem nezahrnuje naše “ruce a záda”, ale naše kognitivní schopnosti, tedy inteligenci. Můžeme říct, že jsme „nepracovali“ s počítačem, ale začali jsme skrze ně myslet. Zachránit designéry přišly až nové znalosti a poznatky ze zdánlivě nesouvisejících oborů kognitivní vědy a nového oboru HCI.</p>\n<h2>Kognitivní věda a HCI</h2>\n<p>Kognitivní věda má v HCI dlouhou a důležitou historii. Ve velké míře jsme i dnes ovlivněni teoriemi, které se začaly používat pro návrh interakce mezi člověkem a počítačem. Právě začátkem osmdesátých let se obory lidských faktorů a ergonomiky doplnily o poznatky z kognitivní vědy. Milníkem byla v roce 1983 kniha The Psychology of Human-computer Interaction (Card, 1983), která de facto ustanovila obor HCI. Autoři v knize kritizovali dosavadní orientaci oboru lidských faktorů a argumentovali pro větší důraz na teorii na základě aplikování znalostí z kognitivní psychologie: „[&#8230;] Uživatel není operátor. Neobsluhuje počítač, ale komunikuje s ním“ (citováno v Grudin, 2012).</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obor HCI se stal hlavním oborem pro návrh počítačových uživatelských rozhraní. Pod vlivem kognitivních věd přijal teorie i experimentální výzkum, které objasňovaly, jakou roli hraje při práci s počítačem naše paměť, pozornost, vnímání, učení, mentální modely, rozhodování a další naše schopnosti i limitace. Již zmíněná kniha </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Psychology of Human-computer Interaction</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> zavedla do oboru HCI jednu z nejdůležitějších a nejvlivnějších metafor toho, co to je člověk a jak funguje jeho myšlení. Tato kniha, inspirovaná výzkumem v kognitivních vědách a oborem Umělé inteligence totiž přijala metaforu a teorii </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kognitivismu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, tzn. že člověk a jeho myšlení není nic jiného než informační zpracování určitých abstraktních nebo fyzických symbolů na základě fixních, předem určených pravidel, nebo chcete-li, algoritmů. Stručně řečeno, člověk se stal explicitně digitálním počítačem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asi nejznámější obrázek, který toto ilustruje, je animovaná postava nazvaná trefně a bez špetky ironie „model lidského procesoru“</span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1121\" style=\"width: 1385px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1121\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1121\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Model-Human.jpg\" alt=\"Model-Human\" width=\"1375\" height=\"1759\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-1121\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Model lidské kognice jako procesoru</p></div></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kognitivismus v HCI znamenal, že výzkumníci se zevrubně zaměřovali na optimalizaci komunikace s počítačem. Rychlost klikání, počet uhozených slov za vteřinu, a následování fixních pravidel pro dokončení předem definovaných úkolů se staly jádrem HCI výzkumu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phil Turner vyjmenovává nejpoužívanější metody vycházející z kognitivistického pohledu na HCI, mezi nimi například GOMS model (Goals, Operators, Methods a Selections rules), KLM (Keystroke-Level model), CCT (Cognitive Complexity Theory), TAG (Task Action Grammar) či analýza úkonů.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HCI pod vlivem kognitivismu, který ve výzkumu trvá dodnes, redukoval člověka na počítač, který vše, co potřebuje ke svému myšlení a chování, má v hlavě. Tam se děje vše důležité. Pro HCI, ale i obskurnější dnešní obory jako Usability engineering (inženýrství použitelnosti) to znamenalo a znamená, že nejpoužívanější metody se dějí na dálku, nebo v laboratořích, často na základě kvantitativních výzkumů z analytických nástrojů. Navíc zcela oproštěných od reálných kontextuálních faktorů. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byl to tedy pouhý povrchní a umělý pohled na každodenní lidské zážitky s technologií. Lidské prožívání technologií bylo redukováno na nedočkavé pracovníky, kteří chtějí dokončit svou práci co nejrychleji. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ale není jediný vztah, který máme k počítačům a obecně k technologiím. Každopádně od osmdesátých let a řekněme následujících deset či dvacet let to byl predominantní pohled. Není divu, v této prehistorii byl design v IT sprostým slovem, interface navrhovali programátoři a manažeři určovali, jaké úkony jsou pro uživatele softwaru důležité. Role uživatele a obecněji člověka byla negativní, chápáno jako “ty iracionální lidské aspekty” softwaru, které byly noční můrou pro většinu programátorů, protože uživatelé často dělali to, co nebylo ve scénáři.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Přestože kognitivismus sjednotil výzkum v HCI a někteří jej nazývají zlatým věkem HCI, na mnoho otázek se nedostalo. Například kognitivismus upozaďoval nebo ignoroval: kdo je uživatel, jaký je jeho život? Případně: je doktorský student nebo studentka Matfyzu na Karlově univerzitě stejný uživatel jako babička v důchodu? Je interakce smysluplná pro uživatele? Řeší jeho potřeby, zlepšuje mu život? Jaký je kontext, místo, čas, ve kterém uživatel interaguje s technologií?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S postupným příchodem chytrých zařízení a přístupů jako všudypřítomná výpočetní technika (anglicky možná známěji jako ubiquitous computing), případně Internet věcí dnes vidíme, že kognitivistické zaměření pouze na to, co se děje v naší hlavě, bylo velmi omezující. Ale to předbíháme.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jelikož v osmdesátých a devadesátých letech neexistovaly iPhony a iPady, nebylo jednoduché si představit, jaký vztah k techologiím lidé budou mít a jak budou technologie ovlivňovat naše životy. I proto kritika dosavadního kognitivistického přístupu v HCI přicházela především z neočekávaných oborů: filozofie, výzkumu Umělé inteligence, ale také samozřejmě i z HCI samotného, kde jedna z prvních kritik přišla od člověka, kterého většina posluchačů zná. Byl to Don Norman, který, jak ještě ukážu, měl, podle mého názoru, prsty ve všech důležitých okamžicích HCI a UX oborů.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kritika kognitivismu</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tato část mé přednášky patří k nejhutnější a poskytuje nejdůležitější argumenty, proč to, čemu dnes říkáme UX, bylo nutné, aby vzniklo. Znamenalo to ale podstoupit velký souboj s dominantním přesvědčením, že lidská mysl funguje jako informační procesor na základě zpracování symbolů podle fixních, algoritmických pravidel. Pokud kognitivismus ve svém jádře je špatný, znamenalo by to, že obory HCI i Umělé inteligence, které z něj vychází, jsou taktéž ve svém jádře špatné. Neznamená to, že úplně vše by bylo nutné zahodit, ale naše představa o tom, co je člověk a jak se orientuje v životě, byla mylná.</span></p>\n<h3><b>John Searle</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeden z velkých kritiků kognitivismu byl a je známý americký filozof John Searle. Ve svém myšlenkovém experimentu nás nabádá, abychom si představili následující situaci. V uzavřeném pokoji sedí člověk, Bob, který neumí čínsky. Co ale má k dispozici je kniha, pomocí které je schopný reagovat na každou zprávu napsanou v čínštině. Venku před pokojem stojí žena, která ovládá čínštinu, například Alice. Ta posílá pod dveřmi do pokoje zprávy napsané v čínštině. Uvnitř pokoje se Bob podívá na zprávu, podle své velké knihy transformačních pravidel napíše odpověď, kterou opět pošle pod dveřmi. Alice se domnívá, že Bob umí čínsky, ale podle Searla tomu tak není. Bob pouze následuje algoritmus transformace symbolů a nemá žádné reálné porozumění jazyku. Searle zde chce ukázat, že čistě forma symbolů, tedy syntax, nedokáže produkovat porozumění, význam, smysl, tedy sémantiku.</span></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TryOC83PH1g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokud tedy kognitivismus říká, že člověk není nic jiného než počítač zpracovávající symboly, se kterými manipuluje tak jako Bob v Čínském pokoji podle připravených fixních pravidel, Podle Searla bychom pak “neměli ničemu rozumět”. Což není běžná zkušenost a zážitek našich životů. I přes značnou kritiku se zdá, že Searlův útok na “silnou logickou AI”, tedy kognitivismus, stále platí.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Don Norman</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Další kritik kognitivismu byl Don Norman. Již v roce 1980 napsal článek </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twelve issues for cognitive science</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Dvanáct problémů pro kognitivní vědu), který je dle mého názoru bohužel komunitou HCI a UX odborníků zbytečně ignorován, přestože jinak Normana každý z nás četl a čte.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V tomto článku Norman poukázal na zcela zjevné věci. Tvrdí, že nejsme umělé bytosti, ale že jsme živé organismy s evoluční historii, která nás ovlivňuje. Zároveň žijeme v reálném světě a naše myšlení a jednání je ovlivněno kulturou, sociálními interakcemi, motivacemi a </span><b>emocemi</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Což jsou aspekty našeho jednání a interakce s technologií, které byly zcela ignorovány a v mnoha ohledech stále dodnes jsou. Norman argumentoval, že bychom měli přestat následovat kognitivistický přístup a místo toho začít studovat člověka a jeho interakci s technologií systémově orientovanou a kybernetickou optikou komplexních interakcí a zpětných smyček mezi </span><b>lidmi (uživateli), prostředním, historií, kulturou a společností.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Otázkou je, co má prostředí, kultura, nebo naše fyzické tělo společné s tím, jak myslíme, jednáme nebo interagujeme s technologií a interfacem? Jak ukázal Norman i jeden neznámý filozof, ten triviální fakt, že nejsem umělé bytosti, ale že </span><b>jsme všichni ve fyzickém světě, má zásadní vliv na to, jak jednáme</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Dreyfus, Winograd, Heidegger a kritika AI</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokud Searle říká, že kognitivismus nám nedokáže poskytnout odpověď, odkud se bere význam, co přesně dává smysl našim akcím a věcem kolem nás?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zmínění filozofové argumentují, že význam má co do činění s tím, jak reálně prožíváme každodenní svět kolem nás. Zatímco kognitivismus z nás udělal vědce nebo počítače, které neustále kalkulují, analyzují a porovnávají možnosti, abychom dosáhli optimálního jednání, filozofové i současné behaviorální ekonomové tvrdí, že náš přístup ke světu je veskrze praktický a nejběžnější způsob, jak interagujeme s věcmi ve světě jsou běžné, každodenní činnosti. Bereme naše děti do školy, píšeme emaily, děláme rozhodnutí, když nakupujeme na farmářském trhu nebo řešíme, jak pracovat s tou novou tiskárnou v naší kanceláři. Každý den se potýkáme s praktickými problémy, abychom dosáhli našich potřeb a cílů. Ale tato myšlenka je ještě hlubší: používáme také věci kolem nás k řešení problémů a tyto věci mají pro nás význam. Ne proto, že je analyzujeme, ale protože se nám tyto věci jeví </span><b>jako nástroje, kterými můžeme něco udělat nebo rozšířit naše přirozené lidské schopnosti</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><b>Nástroje a obecně věci kolem nás mají význam na základě toho, že je používáme a interagujeme skrze ně s prostředím kolem nás.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ale i přesto, že nástroje a věci kolem nás mají význam na základě toho, co s nimi děláme, nejsou tyto významy </span><b>fixní, ale mění se podle kontextu. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jak tomu můžeme rozumět?</span></p>\n<h3><b>PET </b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Můj oblíbený příklad je prachobyčejná PET lahev. Když se vás zeptám na funkci nebo význam PET láhve, většina lidí odpoví, že se používá jako nádoba pro tekutinu a forma láhve je specificky navržena, aby lidem pomáhala láhev držet a pít zní. Skutečně se na první pohled zdá, že </span><b>forma následuje funkci</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, jak mnoho designérů i ostatních někdy tuhle známou frázi slyšelo.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1122\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet_bottle.png\" alt=\"pet_bottle.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet_bottle.png 800w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet_bottle-300x225.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet_bottle-768x576.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jak potom ale vysvětlíme, že skupina ekologických aktivistů používá PET láhve v rámci udržitelného zahradničení jako květináče, aby upozornili i redukovali zbytečné a nebezpečné plýtvání plasty? Tenhle jednoduchý příklad mě kdysi nečekaně přinutil se zamyslet. Skutečně forma vždy následuje funkci? Byla forma a význam PET láhve jako květináče pro ekologický aktivismus zabudována do láhve v momentě, kdy ji designér navrhoval? Předpokládám, že nikoli. Ale forma </span><b>dovoluje či poskytuje (anglicky affords) </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">takovou funkci, a proto také mnoho lidí skutečně používá PET láhev jako květináč a mnoho dalších použití. Proto bychom ale staré motto </span><b>forma následuje funkci měli změnit a říct, že také funkce následuje formu. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A co je také zajímavé, všimněte si, že PET láhev nejen změnila svůj význam, ale získala význam zcela opačný. Ze symbolu plýtvání plasty se stala nástrojem pro lepší svět.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Příběh za tímto příběhem o PET láhvi ukazuje na důležitý bod pro designéry. Význam a dokonce i funkce objektů kolem nás nejsou fixní. Jistě, objekty jsou nepochybně navrhovány s určitým úmyslem, ale lidskou kreativitu nelze zastavit. Lidé využijí všech dostupných prostředků v daném kontextu, aby vyřešili své problémy. Nejedná se pouze o PET láhve, je to obecně o našem vztahu k věcem, objektům, nástrojům a technologii kolem nás.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Někteří si mohli všimnout, že mezi řádky hovořím o tom, čemu se v designu i v psychologii říká afordance. Původní definice afordancí říká, že afordance jsou jednoduše vlastnosti objektů, které nám umožňují určité akce. Prototypickým příkladem je židle. Vzhled a materiál židle nám umožňuje sedět. PET láhev nám umožňuje pít, ale i ji používat jako květináč. Pisoár nám umožňuje jednu zřejmou věc, ale také může být použit jako jedno z nejzásadnějších uměleckých děl dvacátého století, jak nám ukázal francouzský umělec Marcel Duchamp.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1123\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fountain.jpg\" alt=\"fountain.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"713\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fountain.jpg 600w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fountain-252x300.jpg 252w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Filozof Hubert Dreyfus souhlasí s Donem Normanem, že afordance, význam věcí a tedy akce, které s nimi můžeme dělat, nejsou do nich vytesané předem, ale jsou relativní. A přesně toto byl argument, kterým mohl Dreyfus kritizovat z pozice filozofa nejlepší odborníky na světě v oboru Umělé inteligence. Přestože pracoval v tak významných institucích jako M.I.T. nebo Standford, žádný AI odborník nedokázal odpovědět na to, jak umělá inteligence může rozhodnout, co je v daném kontextu relevantní a co ne. Tento problém, technicky nazvaný “frame problém” Dreyfus vysvětluje následovně: to, co pro nás je významné a relevantní závisí do velké míry na tom, kdo jsme, v jaké společnosti žijeme, jakou kulturou jsme ovlivněni, ale také tím, v jaké konkrétní situaci se nacházíme, jaké jsou naše potřeby a cíle. Umělá inteligence vycházející z kognitivismu neexistovala v reálném světě, neměla reálné tělo, reálné potřeby apod. Tudíž veškerá relevance musela být naprogramována předem. Nejdřív to výzkumníci AI a robotiky řešili tak, že kontext definovali například jako “kuchyň”, “zahrada” či “ráno” a ke každému kontextu definovali, jaké akce jsou relevantní. Jenže Dreyfus poznamenal, že to problém neřeší, pouze posouvá o úroveň výše. Nyní bylo potřeba definovat, jak AI vybere nikoli relevantní akce, ale relevantní kontext. Pro ten bylo potřeba definovat meta-kontext apod. Dreyfus tedy tvrdí, že tento tzv. “Frame problém” neměl ve výzkumu založeném na kognitivismu řešení. Relevance a význam není pouze v naší hlavě, ale závisí na kontextu situace, ve které se nacházíme. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Lucy Suchman and situated actions</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tenhle předpoklad důležitosti kontextu zkoumala ve své dizertační práci ve společnosti Xerox antropoložka Lucy Suchman. Rozhodla se zaměřit na tehdy dosavadní kognitivistické dogma, které zpochybnila. Suchman velmi přesně argumentovala, že lidé nesledují fixní plány, ale jednají na základě dynamické interakce s materiálními objekty, sociálními a kulturními vlivy dané situace. Zatímco kognitivismus si představoval svět jako statické pozadí, Suchman ukázala, že lidé své chování neustále “updatují” a přízpůsobují dané situaci. Její výzkum vedl k zavedení nového směru v kognitivní vědě nazvaného </span><b>situovaná kognice</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a byl přímým stimulem k tomu, aby se v oborech HCI/UX začaly používat metody pro zkoumání reálných praktik lidí v jejich reálných kontextech, tak jak je zkoumají antropologové, sociologové či etnografové. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Tacitní znalosti </b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Další důvod pro potřebu kontextuálního či etnografického výzkumu je fakt, že ne všechny znalosti a myšlenky jsou lidé schopni vyslovit či převést do slovní podoby. Jedná se o problém tzv. Tacitních znalostí, který může z praktického hlediska být známý i manažerům a byznys leadrům, kteří mají na starosti sdílení a management znalostí v podniku. Tacitní znalosti jsou ty, &nbsp;u kterých se ptáme, “jak udělat nějakou věc”, na rozdíl od typu znalosti “co něco je”. Znalost “Co” je na příklad znalost data vzniku Československa nebo jméno prvního českého prezidenta. Zatímco pod znalostí “Jak” si můžeme představit znalost toho, jak se plave, jak se hraje na klavír apod. Samozřejmě existují určité poučky a doporučené postupy, ale bez toho, aniž by člověk skutečně sedl před klavír, se na klavír nikdy nenaučí hrát. Problémem tacitních znalostí je, že pokud je nelze dobře popsat a je nutné je ukázat, člověk musí být přímo “u toho”, aby měl šanci aspoň pochopit, jak se daná věc dělá, jak a proč funguje. Lidé, týmy, organizace a firmy mají ve svých životech i strukturách mnoho tacitních znalostí i proto, že lidé si mnoho každodenních činností automatizují. Avšak co je pro jednoho denní rutina, nad kterou nepřemýšlí, pro designéra a UX výzkumníky, kteří se snaží mapovat kontext, jak lidé dělají určité věci, jsou tacitní znalosti nesmírně cenné, důležité a také těžké zmapovat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proto i zde, pro zjištění skrytých, automatizovaných, tacitních znalostí je etnografický výzkum důležitý. Neznamená to, že odkryje vše důležité, to samozřejmě záleží na talentu a zkušenostech výzkumníka, ale má pro to větší potenciál než spekulace z designérského křesla nebo laboratorní výzkum, kde je testovaný subjekt vyvržen ze svého běžného prostředí.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emoce a zážitky ovlivňují a jsou ovlivňovány</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Po kritice kognitivismu a nastínění postkognitivismu můžeme konečně také něco říct o emocích a zážitcích, na které ostatně aspoň podle svého názvu User Experience Design cílí. Jak už to v HCI/UX komunitě bývá zvykem, byl to opět Don Norman, který popularizoval myšlenku, že kromě utilitárních aspektů produktů jsou důležité také emocionální a estetické prožitky. Tím má Norman nepochybně pravdu. Norman ve své nové knize přiznává, že ve svém bestselleru </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Design of the Everyday Things</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> zcela emoce vynechal a zaměřoval se pouze na funkčnost, použitelnost a formu. Nyní knihou </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotional Design</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> publikovanou v roce 2004 chce své opomenutí napravit. Otázkou je, jak designovat emocionální a estetické prožitky?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Susanne </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bødkerová komentuje Normanovu knihu a překvapivě jí kritizuje. Nikoli, že by nesouhlasila, že emoce a estetické prožitky jsou pro návrh interakcí s technologií důležité, ale říká, že Norman sice píše, že emoce ovlivňují naše myšlení (a naopak to také platí), ale je stále zakotven v kognitivistickém paradigmatu. Bødkerová má pravdu, Norman na straně 11 píše, že myšlení i emoce jsou kognitivní systémy v našich hlavách zpracovávající informace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pro Bødkerovou a Boehnerovou et al. (Boehner et al., 2005) a další jsou emoce, zážitky a přisuzování významu věcem důležitými aspekty formující povahu interakce s technologiemi, odmítají ale kognitivistickou tezi, že je možné pochopit a studovat jejich příčiny “nahlížením do hlavy” jedinců. Opozice kognitivismu nejen v HCI tvrdí, že naše psychologické stavy jsou výsledkem komplexním propojením člověka, kultury, společnosti a také místa a času, ve kterém se jedinec vynachází. Emoce, zážitky, významotvornost a interakce lze chápat jako dynamický, kulturně a sociálně konstruovaný a prožívaný proces (Boehner et al., 2005). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emoce tak můžeme chápat jako význam, který přisuzujeme PET láhvi. Můžeme při nejpoctivější vědecké analýze materiálu láhve objevit, že její význam je ekologický aktivismus? Nikoli, teprve při zasazení do širšího kontextu kultury a společnosti začíná něco jako “ekologický aktivismus” existovat a může tak být i významem PET lahve. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Podobně emoce je třeba chápat jako příběh, který se rozprostírá v čase a prostoru. Co lidé pociťují jako krásné nebo, proč lidé žárlí, je ovlivněno vnějšími faktory, a proto zážitky i emoce je nutné studovat na rozhraní člověka, místa, času, společnosti a kultury. Tedy v kontextu. Jedna proměnná kontextu ještě chybí. A tou jsou technologie a jejich vliv na člověka. Určité vodítko k tomuto vztahu poskytuje současná kognitivní věda, která zkoumá jiné než kognitivistické teorie. Proto se také nazývají postkognitivistické. A mimo jiné nám ukazují, jak zásadní roli v našem jednání a myšlení technologie má.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Postkognitivistické teorie </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Postkognitivistické teorie jsou zjednodušeně takové teorie myšlenek, které se explicitně vyhrazují vůči kognitivismu ve všech oborech, kde byl kognitivismus dominantním přístupem. Pro HCI a UX i pro mě samotného jsou postkognitivistické teorie velmi zajímavé, neboť nám ukazují, že náš vztah k nástrojům a technologiím je mnohem užší a intimnější, než jsme si mysleli. Už teď mohu říct, že vize kyborga, které známe ze science fiction, nebyla kompletně fikcí.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Vtělená kognice </b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teorie vtělené kognice v návaznosti na tacitní znalosti upozorňuje na to, že naše tělo především právě v tacitních znalostech hraje důležitou roli a musí být bráno jako zásadní součást našeho myšlení. Například Eleanor Rosch v knize </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> píše, že vtělená kognice znamená v první řadě, že naše myšlení je závislé na takových zážitcích či prožívání, které jsou spojené s faktem, že máme tělo a několik tělesných kapacit. Pokud potřebujeme tělo, abychom vyjádřili určitou znalost (například hraní na klavír), pak to znamená, že kognitivistická vize, že vše k myšlení máme uvnitř naší hlavy, je špatně. Za druhé Rosch tvrdí, že naše těla jsou sama vnořena do širšího biologického, psychologického a kulturního kontextu. Což je mnohem kontroverznější bod, který však má své zastánce v dalších postkognitivistických teoriích: v rozšířené a distribuované kognici.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1126\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tumblr_n7vzht9O031r4tdazo1_1280-900x400-2.jpg\" alt=\"tumblr_n7vzht9O031r4tdazo1_1280-900x400.jpg\" width=\"900\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tumblr_n7vzht9O031r4tdazo1_1280-900x400-2.jpg 900w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tumblr_n7vzht9O031r4tdazo1_1280-900x400-2-300x133.jpg 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tumblr_n7vzht9O031r4tdazo1_1280-900x400-2-768x341.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<h3><b>Rozšířená, distribuovaná kognice</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyto teorie zastávají názor, že naše myšlení prosakuje i do vnějšího prostředí kolem nás. Jak jen je to možné a co by to reálně znamenalo, že prostředí je součástí našeho kognitivního systému?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schválně se zeptám: “kdo z vás si pamatuje telefonní číslo partnera nebo partnerky? Matky, otce či babičky? Proč byste vůbec měli, naše životy jsou už tak dostatečně komplikované, takže pokud můžeme “outsourcovat” část naší paměti do chytrých zařízeních typu iPhone nebo iPad, jistě tak uděláme.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1127\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DP818682-e1525125315557.jpg\" alt=\"DP818682\" width=\"600\" height=\"867\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Podle filosofů a psychologů jako Andy Clark, David Chalmers nebo Edwin Hutchins a dalších bychom měli tento vztah k technologii brát vážně. Čím více jsme obklopeni technologiemi, tím více odkládáme naše myšlení na chytrá zařízení. Jak zmínění teoretici a teorie navrhují, další lidi, technologické artefakty a prostředí kolem nás, bychom měli brát jako rozšířený a distribuovaný systém naší mysli, který nám pomáhá i ovlivňuje naše myšlení.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Lev Vygotskij a kulturně-historická psychologie&nbsp;</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Může se zdát, že teorie rozšířené a distribuované kognice jsou výsledkem nedávného výzkumu, ale jak nám ukazují HCI/UX výzkumnící Victor Kaptelini a Bonnie Nardi v knize </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acting with Technology Activity Theory and Interaction Design</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, jeden sovětský psycholog se vlivem technologie a obecnějších, každodenních objektů zabýval již ve třicátých letech. Jmenoval se Lev Vygotskij a studoval u dětí jejich psychologický vývoj a proces učení. Všiml si, že děti i dospělí používají různé nástroje, které nejdříve slouží jako externí pomůcky pro myšlení. Postupně ale lidé přestanou tyto nástroje potřebovat, neboť si, slovy Vygotského, a omlouvám se za zbytečný technický termín, daný proces internalizovali. Což znamená, že nástroje ne úplně triviálním způsobem disciplinují, trénují a formují naše myšlení. Vygotskij mezi nástroje nepovažoval pouze nástroje fyzické, ale také ty, kterým říkal psychologické neboli nemateriální. Mezi tyto nástroje počítal jazyk, matematické notace apod, tedy to, co je součástí naší kultury.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vygotskij navíc poukázal na to, že ve fyzických i psychologických nástrojích je uložena naše kultura, zkušenosti a zážitky určité společnosti nebo skupiny lidí.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1128\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/60495.jpg\" alt=\"60495.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/60495.jpg 640w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/60495-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">U Vygotského se objevuje zajímavý vztah mezi člověkem (společností) a nástroji (technologií). Tento vztah je obousměrný. Člověk a společnost ovlivňuje technologie, což se zdá být na první pohled zřejmé; ale na druhou stranu technologie ovlivňuje i nás a to zásadně. Podle Vygotského ovlivňuje naše myšlení i to, jak se učíme nové věci od útlého dětství. Technologie je prostředníkem, médiem, které nám od dětství zpřístupňuje vztah ke světu. Někdy se to, co nám nástroje a technologie umožňuje, naučíme tak dobře, že dochází k internalizaci, typickým příkladem je využití prstů pro počítání. Někdy je technologie nepostradatelná jako v případě urychlovače částic nebo detektoru gravitační vln.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vygotskij nám poskytuje dobré startovní vodítko pro to, abychom si uvědomili důležitost vztahu člověka k technologii. Samozřejmě se nebudeme odvolávat pouze na jednoho člověka. Jednak se můžeme podívat na výzkum v mediální teorii nebo filozofii technologie, kde dříve lidé jako Marshall McLuhan nebo v současné době vynikající filozof technologie a design Peter-Paul Veerbek hovoří o tom, že technologie není něco, co existuje mimo společnost, ale že je její neoddělitelnou součástí, a jako Vygotskij hovoří o tom, že technologie ovlivňuje naše jednání i myšlení. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nakonec není třeba zůstat u teorie, myslím, že každý z nás má osobní zkušenost s tím, jak je jeho život ovlivňován současnými technologiemi, které již ani nevnímá, neboť se staly běžnou součástí našich životů. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Budeme-li brát seriózně myšlenku, že technologie je nedílnou součástí kultury a společnosti, pak to znamená, že současné metody pro zkoumání kontextu nemusí být dostatečné, pokud se nezaměřují na to, jak nás technologie ovlivňuje. Jaké jsou současné kontextuální metody v designu?</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participativní design a HCD Design zaměřený na člověka, jsou dostatečné?</span></h2>\n<h3><b>Participativní design</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participativní design byl a stále je první systematickou metodou zkoumání širšího prostředí toho, jak lidé pracují. Participativní design se začal používat a šířit v 70. letech ve skandinávských zemích. Právě zde za vlády levicově orientovaných politických stran, které usilovaly o práva zaměstnanců, byla vhodná atmosféra na to, aby zaměstnanci firem začali být více než číslem ve velkých korporacích. Designéři začali spolupracovat s jednotlivými zaměstnanci a dalšími zúčasněnými stranami (stakeholders). PD využívá jejich znalosti pro design nových systémů a produktů. Dává to smysl, designéři jsou odborníci na kreativní řešení problémů a naslouchání lidem, nejsou experti na daně nebo pěstování brambor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A právě zaměstnanci pracující dvacet let v určité sekci mají mnoho zkušeností a tacitních znalostí toho, jak věci fungují nebo nefungují. Je jasné, že ne každý zaměstnanec je designér. Úkolem designérů a výzkumníků proto je, aby na základě rozhovorů a pozorování zaměstnanců v jejich reálném kontextu na reálné práci získali vhodná data pro design nového systému. Společné designování a spolupráce zaměstnanců a designérů se z radikálněji laděné levicové politiky usilující o emancipaci pracovního života stala mainstreamem. Co bylo dříve politicky laděná agenda se začalo jevit jako dobré praktiky a selský rozum. Spolupracovat s lidmi, kteří mají mnoho odborných, i když tacitních znalostí, dává smysl. Participativní design jako metoda se původně prosadila v prostředí pracovních aktivit. Není ale důvod, proč jeho metody a pohled na design neužívat i mimo pracovní prostředí.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Human-centred design</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Další metodou, jak zkoumat kontext z pohledu člověka, je human-centred design. O jeho popularizaci se zasloužilo vynikající designové studio IDEO nebo například v akademickém prostředí program d.school při univerzitě Standford, kde se učí byznys, management a design jako neoddělitelná součást toho, jak dělat inovace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HCD lze například popsat následovně:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">„Snahou designérů je v tomto případě porozumět tomu, co cílová skupina </span><b>potřebuje</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, jaké má </span><b>přání</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><b>sny</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, jakým způsobem </span><b>vystupuje </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a jaké je její </span><b>typické chování</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Designéři zaměření na human centered design si tedy nejprve kladou otázku, co si cílová skupina přeje a co potřebuje, poté jakým způsobem jejich přání technicky, finančně a organizačně zrealizovat.“</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HCD se oprosťuje od tradičního designu zaměřeného na “produkt”, tedy fyzické nebo digitální objekty a zaměřuje se na člověka, širší kontext jeho života, jeho potřeby, problémy. Jedním z nejvíce skloňovaných hesel v rámci HCD je “empatie”, neboť právě vžití se do role jednotlivých lidí je pro HCD zásadní. Proto HCD používá metody z oborů sociologie či antropologie, především etnografický výzkum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Na základě toho, co jsme si podrobně řekli o problémech kognitivismu a postkognitivistických teoriích, je zcela v pořádku, že HCD používá etnografické a antropologické výzkumy pro studium kontextu a získání užitečných dat pro design. Navíc, mnoho firem zjistilo, že zaměřením se na člověka a jeho potřeby skutečně lze tvořit lepší produkty a služby.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1130\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Corbusier_New-Urban-Ideas-Paris_1920s_1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Corbusier_New-Urban-Ideas-Paris_1920s_1.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Corbusier_New-Urban-Ideas-Paris_1920s_1-1.jpg 700w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Corbusier_New-Urban-Ideas-Paris_1920s_1-1-300x129.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Můj oblíbený příklad toho, jak to v designu dopadne, když se neberou lidské potřeby v potaz, je z roku 1924. Jedná se o architektonický plán redesignovat centrum Paříže, který navrhl světoznámý architekt Le Corbusier. Jeho plán nazvaný &nbsp;(Radiant City) je ukázkou mrazivé technicistní a nelidské krásy. Kognitivní psycholog Steven Pinker komentuje, že tento plán ignoruje potřebu měřítka budov, které je blíže lidským rozměrům, potřebu zeleně apod. Nicméně Corbusierův žák a následovník Oscar Niemeyer dokázal použít myšlenky svého učitele pro design hlavního města Brazílie. Je na každém, aby posoudil, zda mělo takto centrum Paříže vypadat nebo nikoli.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1131\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/corbu-model-1.jpg\" alt=\"corbu-model-1.jpg\" width=\"736\" height=\"1081\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/corbu-model-1.jpg 736w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/corbu-model-1-204x300.jpg 204w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/corbu-model-1-697x1024.jpg 697w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Má Human-centred design i nějaké zápory? Vždyť se orientuje na člověka. Zkoumá jeho názory a potřeby. Na základě nich se designéři snaží navrhovat také produkty a služby, které je budou naplňovat. Paradoxně v tom ale tkví také jeho slabiny. Orientace pouze na člověka znamená, že ze zkoumání kontextu jsme vynechali nebo upozadili dalšího mocného aktéra dnešní doby, který jednoznačně je součástí našich životů, a to technologii.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technologie jako druhá strana mince vztahu člověk-stroj</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V době všudypřímné komputace a internetu věcí jsou technologie v našich životech na každém kroku. Zakladatel UbiComp Mark Weiser napsal, že ideální stav počítačové techniky bude takový, až se technologie kolem nás stane neviditelnou. Cílem počítačů a technologie pro Weisera bylo, aby byly tichým a neviditelným služebníkem lidstva, aby rozšířili naší inteligenci a intuici. Weiser také tvrdil, že by technologie měly rozšířit naše nevědomí. Podle něj tohle všechno povede k tomu, že technologie se stanou tzv. “Klidnou technologií”, vytvářející klid a pohodlí bez toho, aniž bychom si byli vědomi, co technologie na pozadí našich životů dělá.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Souhlasím s Mark Weiserem, že evoluční vývoj technologie skutečně mířil a míří k tomu, že existuje více na pozadí našich životů, bez toho aniž bychom měli tušení o tom, co dělá. Ostatně teoretik médií, designu a sociolog Benjamin Bratton napsal v roce 2016 knihu </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Stack</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, ve které neviditelnost technologie komentuje.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bratton tvrdí, že bez našeho vědomí se na pozadí našich životů cosi vytvořio. Je to celoplanetární, technologické a Bratton zdůrazňuje zcela neplánovaná megastruktura, kterou nazývá The Stack. Bratton píše, že různé druhy komputace a technologií, od digitalizovaných rozvoden elektřiny, cloudové platformy, mobilní aplikace, IP6 adresového prostoru, smart cities, internetu věcí, automatizace, interfaců a senzorů, které rozšiřují naše smysly, se něco stalo. Místo toho, abychom tyto odlišné technologie a jejich vliv viděli odděleně, navrhuje Bratton, abychom je chápali jako jeden celek, novou komputační platformu či aparát našich životů. Tato megastruktura se skládá ze šesti propojených vrstev: Země, Cloudu, Města, vrstvy Adres, Interface a nakonec Uživatele. Každá vrstva komunikuje s ostatními, a je tak komponentou jednoho celku. Některým správně může tento model připomínat TCP/IP model OSI vrstev a protokolů internetu. A bude mít pravdu, protože Bratton se ním explicitně inspiroval. Místo TCP/IP vrstev ale Bratton zmiňuje, že The Stack se skládá z komputačních, tedy technlogických, sociálních, lidských a fyzických vrstev. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tento model, ve kterém jsme my jako lidé pouze jednou z vrstev, má dalekosáhlé důsledky pro design, architekturu, urbanismus ale i politická rozhodnutí. Jako každá technologie v sobě obsahuje vliv na naše životy, který je negativní i pozitivní. Zda-li převažuje jedno nebo druhé, si žádá další výzkum.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Interface, UX Design v éře Stacku</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pro mě jako UX designéra ale představuje tato planetární megastruktura neuvěřitelný potenciál. Všimněme si, že před vrstvou User zmiňuje Bratton vrstvu interface. V tomto případě Bratton rozhodně nemyslí pouze buttony, skrollbary, formulářové pole apod. Interface je pro Brattona něco, co nám zprostředkovává vztah ke všem vrstvám Stacku, ke všem technologickým platformám, infrastrukturám, zařízením, ale i dalším lidem. Jelikož naše lidské smysly a kognitivní dovednosti by nikdy nebyly schopné vše toto vnímat, interface je tak pomyslný prostor, kde se tato ohromná komplexita technologických a sociálních vztahů redukuje, komprimuje na něco, co je pro člověka stravitelné. Interface je místo, kde se ohromný potenciál technologických intrastruktur a platforem konkretizuje do nějaké pro člověka vnímatelné podoby. Najednou tak skutečně pomocí tlačítek, páček, gest a dotyků na obrazovce dokážeme ovládat všechny ostatní vrstvy toho celoplanetárního molochu jménem Stack.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1132\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Stack-02.png\" alt=\"The-Stack-02.png\" width=\"1666\" height=\"1316\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Stack-02.png 1666w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Stack-02-300x237.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Stack-02-768x607.png 768w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Stack-02-1024x809.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1666px) 100vw, 1666px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Z tohoto důvodu preferuji slovníkovou definici interface, která říká, že interface je obecně </span><b>bod, kde se dva a více systémů, subjektů, organizací atd. potkává a interagují. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A dle mého je to zcela správně.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1133\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/interface.png\" alt=\"interface.png\" width=\"770\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/interface.png 770w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/interface-300x210.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/interface-768x539.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holandský filosof technologie Peter-Paul Veerbek </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a celý jeden filosofický směr, který se jmenuje postfenomenologie, zastává názor, že designovat technologie a její interface není primárně vůbec o tom, jak samotný </span><b>povrch</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> interface vypadá, nejde primárně o to, jaké tlačítka použijeme, jak na nás působí určité barvy apod.

Pokud je technologie mocnou a všudypřítomnou silou dnešního informačního, síťového a digitálního světa naplněného internetem věcí, chytrými zařízeními a interfacy na každém rohu, potom designéři technologií mají nesmírnou moc ovlivňovat naše životy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dle mého názoru je tak nyní možné načrtnout mnohem zajímavější definice UX designu. Člověk je jen jedna vrstva v megastruktuře Brattonova Stacku. Nebo také jeden uzel v komplexní síti vztahů kultury, společnosti, člověka a technologie. Chceme-li designovat zážitky pomocí interface technologie, znamená to vytvářet určitou redukci této komplexnosti vztahů a vrstev, vytvářet určitý pohled na svět. Jinak řečeno, </span><b>UX design vytváří vztah ke světu. A okno k tomuto vztahu je interface.</b></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Systemický design a UX design jako nástroje sociálních a byznys inovací</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jakým způsobem se UX design může s takovou komplexností vypořádat a jaké metody k tomu má? Nedávno přišly akademické iniciativy v Evropě a v USA s možnou odpovědí, jak se mohou, ba dokonce musí designéři vypořádávat s komplexitou dnešního světa. Jedná se o nově vznikající obor designu, který v sobě integruje principy systémového myšlení a human-centered designu. Obor získal název Systemic design, který znázorňuje jednu důležitou věc pro design: nad všemi designovými problémy je třeba přemýšlet v širším kontextu celého systému, je třeba brát v potaz a předvídat vedlejší efekty na sociální, ekonomické úrovni či úrovni životního prostředí.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Především vliv na životní prostředí je v dnešní době důležitým tématem, zvláště, když se ukázalo, že celá naše planeta, relativně podobně tak jak definuje Bratton, je ovlivňována lidskou činností. Jako oficiální termín pro období, ve kterém jsou veškeré planetární systémy ovlivněny člověkem, se používá slovo Antropocén.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1136\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/anthropocene.png\" alt=\"anthropocene.png\" width=\"860\" height=\"611\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/anthropocene.png 860w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/anthropocene-300x213.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/anthropocene-768x546.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ne všechny vedlejší efekty lze dostatečně dopředu předpovídat. Když Marc Zuckerberg ve svém pokoji programoval Facebook, nepřemýšlel nad tím, že jeho sociální síť budou údajně používat ruské vládní i nevládní organizace pro ovlivňování politického názoru a dokonce voleb v USA.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1137\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gigamap.jpg\" alt=\"gigamap\" width=\"960\" height=\"623\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gigamap.jpg 960w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gigamap-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gigamap-768x498.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pro možnost se poprat s komplexitou zavedl systemický design do designu novou metodu GIGA-mapping, která pomáhá designérům vizualizovat všechny možné komponenty a jejich vzájemné vztahy v “systému”, do kterého budou zavádět nějaké nové designové změny. GIGA-mapování poskytuje komplexní a bohatý obraz reálné situace, kombinuje různé druhy médií (obraz, grafiku, fotografie, text apod.), umožňuje designérům vidět a přecházet z makroskopického pohledu na systém k mikroskopickému detailu nějaké jedné části, jsou zde vizualizovány informace a relevantní data z různých oborů, a slouží jako nástroj pro konečnou designovou syntézu, kdy designéři vytvářejí nějaké řešení.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sociální a byznys inovace</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Systemický design, GIGA-mapping a obecně systémový pohled na současnost umožňuje pohled do budoucnosti. Kreativita a designová řešení nikdy nevznikají ve vzduchoprázdnu. Kreativita a design je svým způsobem nové, vhodné a funkční spojení dvou a více částí, které doposud existovaly samostatně. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Systemický design i UX design, pokud se budou dívat dostatečně systémově na svět, mohou odhalit potenciální sociální a byznys inovace tím, že právě spojí nesourodé a doposud samostatné prvky, problémy, řešení apod. Docílí toho ale tím, že designéři nebudou pouze pasivními prvky společností a velkých korporátů, ale naopak proaktivními aktéry, kteří vyhledávají potenciální inovace. Designéři jsou k tomu výtečně vybaveni, neboť jejich kognitivní dovednosti a talent je předurčuje k tomu, že v chaosu komplexity různorodých vztahů dokážou najít ty správné a vhodné kombinace, které řeší daný problém.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Humanitas Deventer</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeden z mých oblíbených příkladů UX designu, který mě stále fascinuje, a který se dívá na problémy systémově, čímž mohlo dojít k inovaci napříč technologiemi, sociálními problémy a jednotlivými lidmi, je projekt Humanitas Deventer v Holandsku. Jeden z palčivých problémů Holandska je drahé bydlení a zároveň stárnoucí populace. Mladí studenti si nemohou dovolit ani podnájem, zatímco důchodci sice bydlí aspoň v domovech důchodců, ale žijí osamoceným životem. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Podnikatelka a zakladatelka projektu Humanitas Deventer si těchto problémů byla vědoma, a přestože nestudovala na UMPRUM nebo jiné designové škole, přesně jako designérka dokázala myslet systémově a dvě různorodé a zdánlivě nesouvisející věci dokázala propojit.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1138\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/humanitas_01.jpg\" alt=\"humanitas_01.jpg\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/humanitas_01.jpg 810w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/humanitas_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/humanitas_01-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyní Humanitas Deventer umožňuje seniorům cenově přijatelné bydlení v krásném a příjemném prostředí.

Vznikl designový inkubátor Mindlab.dk, který je vlastněn Ministerstvy průmyslu, práce a vzdělání. Mindlab.dk využívá tradičních designových metod participativního designu, HCD a UX designu, aby zlepšil chod státní správy a zajistil rychlejší a plynulejší komunikaci s obyvateli a soukromým sektorem. Jako jeden z hlavních projektů Mindlabu bylo naučit státní správy designovým metodám řešení problémů a také re-design toho, jak v Dánsku nyní funguje vzdělávací systém.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Ainonghui komunita v Číně</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Italský profesor designu Ezio Manzini uvádí ve své knize </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Design, Where everybody design </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s podtitulem </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An Introduction to Design for Social innovation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> další příklad toho, jak designové myšlení dokáže fungovat na rozhraní sociálních, ekonomických i byznys problémů.

Skupina designérů se rozhodna založit projekt a komunitu Ainonghui, který propojuje tyto dvě strany, vzdělává farmáře v marketingu a konzumenty v tom, proč jsou organické a lokální potraviny lepší.

Manzini tvrdí, že designu 21. století bude dominovat design pro sociální inovace, kde soukromý a státní sektor bude muset spolupracovat, aby problémy ve společnosti bylo možné vyřešit, zvláště když Stát jako instituce kvůli svým neflexibilním praktikám, byrokracii a naprosté absenci inovativního myšlení nedokáže myslet (UX) designově.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Projekty jako Humanitas Deventer, ale i mnohem známější platformy jako Uber nebo Airbnb jsou v mých očích symptomy toho, že ve společnosti něco nefunguje. Jelikož ale Uber i Airbnb zasahují do jádra chodu naší společnosti, mám tím na mysli do dopravy a bydlení, bylo zřejmé, že jejich disruptivní potenciál nahradit do jisté míry Stát nebude bez problémů.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Současný svět je globální, digitální, propojený, neustále online. Prolínání státního a soukromého je nevyhnutelné. Současná aféra kolem Facebooku je na jednu stranu drastické porušení práv na soukromí, na druhou stranu z pohledu filosofie technologie a etiky designu nejen digitálních systémů je to fascinující. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use case, jak technologie nestojí mimo společnost. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technologie je společnost</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokud je prolínání soukromého a státního sektoru nevyhnutelné pro řešení sociálních i globálních problémů, bylo by dobré se nikoli tomuto stranit, ale naopak tuto možnost co nejvíce přijmout. Design si vždycky užíval zvláštního postavení mezi uměním a byznysem, mezi službou “lidu” a kapitálu, ale také mezi tím, co patří člověku a co nabízí technologie. Můj názor je, že bychom tyto vztahy měli nejen přijmout, ale nejvíce podněcovat. Ne v zákulisí poslaneckých klubů, ale transparentně a otevřeně jako inovativní designovou strategii pro 21. století. Design měl v sobě vždycky trochu utopického myšlení, protože se zcela programově nedíval na to, jaké věci jsou, ale, jak věci mohou nebo mají být. Nedíval se na existují svět, ale na svět možný. Abychom si však byli aspoň trochu jisti, že nové nápady a změny nepovedou k horšímu, potřebujeme určité metody a mapování toho, jak funguje přítomnost. V současné době, kdy vztah technologie a společnosti je tak propojený, že člověk je pouze jednou součástí, jednou komponentou velkého celku, existuje výjimečný potenciál, jak zásadně využít především digitálních technologie a jejich interface</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Z mého pohledu tak lze definovat design, ale především UX design, jako tvorbu možných světů.</span></p>\n<p><em>Tento text jsem 18. 4. 2018 prezentoval ve formě přednášky na pozvání české IT firmy inventi.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Myslím, že to nebude jen můj pocit, když řeknu, že jsme zaplaveni neustále rostoucím seznamem dobrých, horších, ale i výborných článků na téma UX designu.

Ale po četných návštěvách města si Chico uvědomil, že příběh, o kterém se nikdo doposud nezmínil, byl ten z Portbou, jehož důležitost se snížila pouze během posledních dvaceti let. A to kvůli odstranění hranic a nové lince vysokorychlostního vlaku.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Potom, co Chico obrátil svou pozornost na Benjaminův příběh ve vztahu k tomuto městu, vznikl nový, ve stylu eseje napsaný román s pulzem poezie. Román nazvaný <em>Un final para Benjamin Walter</em> (Finále pro Benjamina Waltera) ukazuje, proč je autor Einbahnstraße (Jednosměrné ulice) stále tak živý a mezi námi: Benjamin je výjimečný učitel a čtenář městského prostoru.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To je důvod, proč jiný básník, Američan Kenneth Goldsmith, si vybral jako model pro svůj ambiciózní konceptuální projekt Kapitál vyobrazující New York jako symbolické centrum dvacátého století, nedokončený Benjamínův projekt o Paříži jako kapitálu století devatenáctého. Benjaminův projekt Arkády je archeologií metropolitní minulosti, která je ve skutečnosti strojem pro čtení megalopole budoucnosti.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Táhly židle. Slečna Ángela, zvaná Baldomero, požádal ji, aby je zvedly, ale ony táhly ty židle přes jeho zlatý hlas Angeluse Novuse”, čteme v Mandibula, novém románu spisovatelky Mónicy Ojedy. A pokračuje: “hlas spícího-anděla-historie, jenž diktuje minulost, třebaže jsou nevyhnutelně tlačeny přítomností — jako ty židle — směrem k příslibu budoucnosti dvaceti tří sukní, pěti úsměvů s hranatými závorkami, třech hodinek od Tory Burch, dvaceti a jednoho iPhonu, třinácti iPadů a jednoho růžence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokud mladá ekvádorská spisovatelka jako ikonoklastka proměňuje slavný fragment Tezí o filozofii historie (ve které Benjamin převádí obraz od Paula Kleeho v symbol pokroku), ve výčet ironických a divokých postmoderních objektů, tak jen částečně díky další benjaminovské ctnosti — nejistému světlu našeho jednadvacátého století. Myslím zde jeho nejednoznačnost. Nebo jinými slovy, jeho polysémie.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dodnes se neshodneme na tom, co znamená Angelus Novus. Ani, co Benjamin rozuměl svou Aurou. Nejen, že jeho systém myšlení byl fragmentární a otevřený, ale jeho styl psaní byl tak literární, že je nemožné rozhodnout jeho slovy univokální význam (ne dva, ani tři). Jeho dílo není možné plně zachytit, a proto nepřestává svádět a podněcovat nové výklady.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V latinskoamerické literatuře, od argentinských spisovatelů Ricarda Piglia a Beatriz Sarlo, narozených ve čtyřicátých letech, po španělské autory Miguela Ángela Hernándeze Navarra nebo Césara Renduelese, kteří by mohli být jejich děti, můžeme zmapovat mezigenerační a transatlantickou posedlost autorem díla </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dětství v Berlíně kolem roku 1900</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Here’s what it says. Part I"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"graf graf--h4\"><em>HCI is where design, cognitive science, philosophy, culture, and society meet at the interface. Right now, it’s </em>the one<em> of the most exciting subjects I can think of.</em></p>\n<p id=\"2516\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">There is an ever-growing list of great articles about User Experience design on Medium and other platforms. Many of them are written by UX professionals with impeccable hands-on experience. And I recommend reading what they have to say because practice remains an important asset for any serious designer. Then, why should you read theoretical literature?</p>\n<p id=\"4ea0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My answer is well-known, but I will repeat it anyway: to boldly go where no one has been, it’s necessary to stop and ponder what’s been tried and tested, what works and why. In other words, to think carefully about why you are doing UX the way you do. Correct me if I am wrong but in the high-paced world of information, networks and fluid lives of an always online condition, the UX industry is one of many where everything changes on weekly basis. Not only those who start but also seasoned gurus may feel anxious, without a solid ground, always reading blog posts and adapting to new knowledge, methods and processes, yet thinking “I’m falling behind again”. Although one cannot avoid learning on the go, sometimes what works is to sit down and read for six months a lot of the historical and theoretical literature on UX/HCI. Which is exactly what I did while working on my master’s thesis. Here’s what I’ve learned so far.</p>\n<p id=\"d2f8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In order to understand the current ambiguous state of UX design, it’s better to postpone giving definitions of UX and focus briefly on the history of the field called <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Human-computer interaction, </em>which ultimately is the place where to look for UX’s beginnings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a12e\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">The dawn of HCI</h3>\n<p id=\"7329\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">As always is the case with humanity, innovations happen at war times. During the WW2, the researchers started to analyze why pilots and their planes have accidents, increasing the overall death toll. It became clear that the culprit was dashboards with its knobs and buttons. Their design wasn’t the best example of ergonomics which proved literally lethal. New fields such as “human factors”, “ergonomics”, and “engineering psychology” emerged to make the control of planes easier and less confusing. Professional associations followed, with <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Ergonomic Society</em> founded in 1952 and the American counterpart <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Human Factors Society </em>five years later in 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"80d6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Skipping almost a decade to 1963, Ivan Sutherland, who was inspired by Vannevar Bush’s Memex, published his doctoral dissertation that introduced the first interactive graphical software called <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Sketchpad. </em>Later on, within the walls of the American legendary Xerox PARC company, Sutherland’s work inspired Douglas Engelbart, another of early pioneers, to design the graphical user interface, featuring the desktop metaphor as we know it today. The young Steve Jobs was impressed by the work done at Xerox PARC and decided that GUI would be the future of personal computing. Putting his money where the mouth is, he based Apple’s and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT\">NeXT</a>’s operating systems on Engelbart’s work. These projects brought computers to masses and daily lives of white-collar workers and later still, all of us.</p>\n<p id=\"63fb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The society was flooded with these new technological objects and their unprecedented force. The impact seemed inevitable. What happened? Millions of people started to rely on the interface as a window onto the functionalities and hidden technical potentials of computers to solve their work, business, and everyday needs. Suddenly, the issue of designing computers and their interfaces for human-computer interaction became an issue and topic on its own. Designers needed a solid framework that could help them with this difficult task. But ergonomics and human factors were essentially <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">a-theoretical, </em>focused on pragmatic solutions that tried to fit the human body and its limitations to machines rather than vice versa. This relationship between humans and machines started to be obsolete. Physical attributes of humans were already less of a concern, rather the work on computers engaged more our cognitive abilities and capacities than our hands and backs. We didn’t “work” with computers, we started to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">think through them</em>. To rescue designers came the work from the seemingly unrelated field: cognitive science and psychology.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8a8c\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Cognitive science and HCI</h3>\n<p id=\"f4ec\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">At the dawn of the 1980s, a-theoretical human factors and ergonomics were supplemented and in the end de facto replaced by new and exciting knowledge from cognitive sciences. The milestone and birth of Human-computer interaction field can be dated to publishing the important work <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Psychology of Human-computer Interaction </em>in 1983<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">. </em>The book attacked the current dogmas in the aforementioned fields and argued for the stronger focus on theory and applications of knowledge from cognitive science. As the book said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"2997\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\"><p>“The user is not [a manual] operator. He does not operate the computer, he communicates with it…”</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"207f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">And it was the communication with computers that started to be studied under the influence of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">the</em> <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">cognitivistic paradigm, </em>which was one of the<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> </em>most ambitious and almost universally accepted claims within cognitive sciences that the human mind may be understood as a human processor and is analogous to a digital computer. It also suggested that the human thinking happens only inside our heads. The notion intuitively correct, but as we will see later on, not entirely. Nevertheless, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">cognitivism</em> was a powerful idea that yielded new successful results in many other fields like Artificial Intelligence research.</p>\n<p id=\"5f75\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In HCI, the cognitive revolution was translated as the view that human use of computers should be studied as an information flow. Many ideas from cognitive science were applied to explaining the role of human cognition, mainly memory, attention, perception, learning, mental models and reasoning and how they relate to the problems in HCI. The widely circulated image of an animated human with various brain subsystems summarizes well the atmosphere of those times. The role of theory in HCI was to research, describe and evaluate the individual subsystems that go into the interaction with computers. Researchers developed elaborate empirical models for optimizing interactions such as <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Keystroke-level model </em>or <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">GOMS </em>(Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection rule). The speed of clicks and keystrokes became paramount. The human mind became a digital computer. Gone was the messiness of human beings engaged with the world, instead it was replaced by the experiences inside experimental laboratories with clinical precision.</p>\n<figure id=\"607b\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"0*TtSTyPfl4UNtBXSJ.\" data-width=\"714\" data-height=\"663\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"0*TtSTyPfl4UNtBXSJ.\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\" width=\"75\" height=\"67\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*TtSTyPfl4UNtBXSJ.\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*TtSTyPfl4UNtBXSJ.\" /></div>\n</div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><em>In my opinion, one of the most pernicious images in HCI textbooks, reducing the human being and her life to basically a slower computer. A caricature indeed.</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p id=\"9c74\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">However, they were a mere artificial outlook at everyday human experiences. In fact, human experiences with computers were reduced to impatient office workers who want to finish their tasks as quickly as possible. Is work really the only relationship we have with computers, or technology in general? And who defined the tasks to be done in the first place? In the dark ages of pre-UX design when programmers were designing interfaces and managers defined what tasks are important to users, it certainly wasn’t the user who had any say in what the technology will look like. On the contrary, the user was an obstacle to be dealt with as fast as possible without spending too much time on those “irrational human aspects” that could be nightmares for most programmers.</p>\n<p id=\"dab7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Admittedly, the insights from cognitive sciences during the 1980s were a significant shift towards a theoretical foundation of HCI. The whole field was flourishing under the umbrella of cognitive science. The <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">cognitiist </em>assumption that the human mind works like a digital computer united the research and practice. According to the HCI researcher John Caroll, it was the “golden age” of HCI for its consistency, without never-ending questioning of the basic assumptions. The future looked bright and goals were clear: to continue the research and improve the precision and effectivity of interacting with computers. However, blinded by the mechanistic view of humans, no one attempted to ask serious questions that, like a Trojan horse slowly waiting in front of the doors, were creeping into the HCI research: Who is the user? Does an M.I.T. graduate in computer science differs from an older lady? Is the interaction meaningful to the user? Does it improve her life and solve the real needs? What is the context, place, time when the user interacts with the computer?</p>\n<p id=\"2d47\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As these questions were rarely asked, the criticism started to show up from different angles and fields. The more technology there was in our life, the more absurd it was to say that we use it only for work. With the arrival of technological convergences such as smart devices and approaches like ubiquitous computing and Internet of Things, we clearly see now how a narrow-minded view it was. But we jump ahead of time too much.</p>\n<p id=\"0bc5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">During the eighties, there were no iPhones, so the critique had to come not from the real experiences with technology, but very piercing and extremely clever arguments from theoretical and somewhat obscure fields. However surprising it is, the most potent critiques of cognitivism not only in HCI but also Artificial Intelligence came from philosophers. Namely, the famous John Searle and the less known Hubert Dreyfus, who specialized in the phenomenology of Martin Heidegger and had almost nothing to do with modern technology. Apart from philosophers, there were scientists by training, inspired by Dreyfus, who joined the dissenting crowd: the AI scientist Terry Winograd, the anthropologist Lucy Suchman and the cognitive scientist who were to become one of the leading voices in the HCI/UX field, Don Norman. In the following paragraphs, I will briefly summarize their criticisms of cognitivism.</p>\n<h3 id=\"40e0\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Criticism of cognitivism in HCI</h3>\n<p id=\"89e9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">To repeat the already stated, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">cognitivism</em> in HCI and AI argued that human beings think and solve everyday problems by applying fixed, algorithmic rules to whatever input comes to the human brain. The input is always represented by some kind of formal symbols (zeros, ones, electricity potentials etc.) A consequent output of these operations influences the behaviour. And remember, all this happens only in the head; we don’t anything outside of our cranium. The dominant metaphor was that we are basically slower and worse digital computers.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2620\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">John Searle</h4>\n<p id=\"7021\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The philosopher John Searle dared to disagree. With his famous Chinese room experiment, he invites us to imagine a scenario where there is a guy named Bob inside a room and outside it stands Alice. She is a native speaker of Chinese and under the door, she sends Chinese messages to the room. Here sits Bob who doesn’t speak Chinese and those symbols appear to him as squiggles. But he has a big book of instructions that gives him all the necessary answers to any message that Alices sends. According to his scenario, Alice writes to Bob, who is able to answer with the help of his book and thus appear to Alice or any outside viewer that he speaks and knows Chinese, although he has no idea what he writes back to the outside world. He just follows the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"6230\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&amp;v=TryOC83PH1g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&amp;v=TryOC83PH1g\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&amp;v=TryOC83PH1g</a></p>\n<p id=\"8227\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Searle compels us to reconsider the cognitivistic dogma. According to Searle, all that Bob does is just a symbol manipulation, or as Searle says, doing “syntactic operations” (syntax) which will never produce real understanding (semantics). Even though Bob follows all the rules, he doesn’t really understand the language, or what the message is about, whether it was a love letter or a notice from a tax collector. Bob, therefore, lacks a real understanding. And since Searle’s experiment is cleverly designed basically to imitate all the modern digital computers based on the Von Neumann architecture, we can conclude that if Bob has no real understanding what his symbol manipulation is about, then no digital computer can. Those formal symbols such as zeroes and ones are not <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">about something</em>, because we cannot interpret their meaning without a broader context or the situation we are in.</p>\n<h4 id=\"291d\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Don Norman</h4>\n<p id=\"d59a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The well-known researcher Don Norman agreed. Already in 1980 he wrote an important article <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Twelve issues for cognitive science,</em> which in my opinion has been neglected unfortunately by the broader HCI/UX community, or overshadowed by his better known books. But let me tell you why you should read a 38-year-old text in the field that moves so fast.</p>\n<p id=\"896e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the article, Norman wonders about how little we actually know about the human cognition. He pointed out the basic fact that we are not artificial beings, but our biology has been formed by evolutionary processes. Compared to the concept of Artificial intelligence, we live in a real world and our cognition and decisions are influenced by culture, social interactions, motivations, and emotions. All these factors were neglected in the previous research. Norman then suggested that cognitive science should put aside the cognitivistic approach and instead start studying human cognition through the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">system-oriented</em>, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">cybernetic </em>lenses of complex interactions and feedback loops between humans, environment, history, culture, and society. In the parlance of cognitive science, it was a surprisingly modern and radical position. What does have the environment and our culture to do with how we think? Apparently, a lot. The human doesn’t stand outside the physical world, she has a physical body. We are <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">embodied </em>creatures. Moreover, each person has own history, problems, needs, worldview and social and cultural background. We all are fundamentally <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">in the world.</em></p>\n<h4 id=\"1f6f\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Dreyfus, Winograd, Heidegger, and affordances</h4>\n<p id=\"621d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Similarly to Don Norman, the philosopher Huber Dreyfus and Terry Winograd with his colleague <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Flores\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Flores\">Fernando Flores</a> agree that cognitive sciences in HCI and AI made a mistake when they didn’t take into account the role of a broader context on our actions and behaviour. Inspired by the German philosopher Martin Heidegger, they attempted to answer the question John Searle’s Chinese room experiment alluded to: where do we get meaning from?</p>\n<p id=\"ffb4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Because we are beings living in the world, we cannot separate ourselves from it. However trivial it sounds, the Western philosophy has been privileging the mind and its separation from the body for almost four hundred years, the historical legacy of the 17th-century French philosopher René Descartes. Despite Cartesian lasting influence on Western philosophical tradition, Heidegger went back to the drawing board and said no, this is not how we <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">are in the world</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"6046\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What does it mean that we as humans live in the world? As Heidegger, Dreyfus and Winograd tell us, the most common way we interact with the world is basic, common, everyday actions. We take our children to schools, write emails, make consumer choices at farm markers or try to solve how the new printer at our office works. We <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">cope</em> every day with practical problems to fulfill our needs. But the insight is deeper than that: we use things around us to solve our problems and those things have meaning for us. Not because we analyze every tool, but the meaning emerges as we use the tool <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">in order to</em> act or extend our natural human capabilities. Tools have meanings by the virtue of us using and interacting through them with the environment. But there are different ways we can use the same tool. How do we choose whether a certain use is suitable? In other words, which meaning and function of a tool are relevant to our current task at hand? The answer is: it depends. On context, to be precise. But how do we square the need of context with the predominant claim in cognitive sciences that what we need is in our heads only and there is no role for social, cultural and situational contextual factors?</p>\n<p id=\"feb6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Enter Dreyfus and his critique of cognitivism in AI found in his book <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">What computers can’t do: A critique of Artificial Reason</em>. We all know the bewildered and skeptical looks when we hear a philosopher talking about technology, programming, or hardware. Just imagine Dreyfus talking to the best AI people in the world who did research at such prestigious US institutions like M.I.T. or Standford. They sneered at his ideas. Some of them were rather hostile to a mild-tempered academics. But Dreyfus was correct, they were wrong.</p>\n<figure id=\"4802\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"0*HfOAXd65SJenINto.jpg\" data-width=\"316\" data-height=\"482\" data-is-featured=\"true\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\" width=\"50\" height=\"75\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HfOAXd65SJenINto.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HfOAXd65SJenINto.jpg\" /></div>\n</div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">The book What computers can’t do: A critique of Artificial reason was a successful critique of cognitivism in AI and HCI research</figcaption></figure>\n<p id=\"2611\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Dreyfus didn’t pay attention to Artificial intelligence until a few students from the AI department attending his classes started to brag about that philosophers were solving these problems about mind and consciousness for thousands of years without any progress, whereas people in AI labs will solve them in a few years. The initial progress in AI seemed it could be a realistic goal. However, Dreyfus answered they will never create a real AI if they don’t radically change the strategies and theories used to build their robots.</p>\n<p id=\"d6f7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The dominant paradigm at that time was of course cognitivism and the mind as information processing and symbol manipulation, i.e. a digital computer. Dreyfus said that the real human intelligence is, however, more akin to a Heideggerian one: solving practical problems based on the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">meaning </em>and context of things in the particular situation. Dreyfus agreed with Don Norman that the meaning of things is not engraved in things beforehand, but rather something given only later at the moment of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">interaction </em>with them<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">. </em>How is that possible?</p>\n<p id=\"2262\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Take a PET bottle, for example. An object everybody is familiar with. If I ask people what the function or meaning of a PET bottle is, most people would say that it is used as a container for certain fluids and the form of the bottle is specifically designed to help people carry and drink from them. It does look like the form follows function. How are we supposed to explain then, when groups of environmental activists use PET bottles as flower pots to counter the wasteful and dangerous attributes of plastic? I was genuinely fascinated when I came across a picture like the one below. It made me thinking. Does the form really follow function? Was the form and meaning of PET bottle as a flower pot for ecological activism in-built by the designer at the very act of designing? I suppose not. But the form <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">affords</em> such function, therefore it has been exploited by many for this particular reason. Then, the old dictum <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">form follows function</em> should be changed to …<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">and function follows form, too</em>. What’s even more interesting: not only did the bottle change its meaning, but it actually gained the meaning which is almost the exact opposite. From a wasteful, unnecessary plastic container for fluids, it has become a container for a birth of new nature.</p>\n<figure id=\"c99c\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"0*B7askRUXQrw7eg_Z.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"480\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\" width=\"75\" height=\"55\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*B7askRUXQrw7eg_Z.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*B7askRUXQrw7eg_Z.jpg\" /></div>\n</div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">The metamorphosis of a PET bottle.

The meaning and even the function of objects around us are not fixed. Surely, the objects are designed with certain uses in mind, but the human creativity is not easy to stop. People will exploit resources in the given context to solve their needs. It’s not just PET bottles, of course. That’s how our relationships with things, objects, tools work in general.</p>\n<p id=\"7225\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Dreyfus knew that from reading Heidegger. Our practically oriented relationship towards the world means that the meaning is partially out there, waiting to be interpreted and exploited by humans, and partially also is socially and contextually constructed. The way we interpret the meanings and is, however, driven by how we live, who we are, what talents and bodies we have. Apart from the pathological cases, the human universal is also that we <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">care</em> about our lives and try to make the best of them. It’s this <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">care</em> that compels us to practically solve our tasks and needs. More importantly, our care and the way we live necessarily restricts what we find meaningful and what not. Therefore, we don’t need to focus on everything around us; that would overwhelm our senses and brains immensely. Instead, we filter our unnecessary things in order to focus on what is relevant. The relevancy comes from our lives, values, culture, society and you can go down the rabbit hole deeper still.</p>\n<p id=\"1988\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That’s why the question of relevancy turned out to be a tough and unsolvable problem for Artificial Intelligence research under the cognitivist paradigm. The researchers were unable to program into robots sufficient ways to perceive the environment and to come up with algorithms that would determine what in the generated internal representation of a current scene should be changed or updated, so as not to update everything all the time. Dreyfus said that you get relevancy and meaning from the context as well as <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">care</em> about life and body. It’s again the being-in-the-world issue that was completely foreign to AI programmers and their gadgets. The algorithms don’t care. In order to change that, Dreyfus suggested that if we want to create AI that has similar abilities like human beings, such AI must also have similar experiences like human beings, which means to have similar body and to live in a similar environment. In fact, we have a variety of inter and multicultural training programs just to get a hint of how it feels to experience the world through the eyes of the other. Because cultures and social factors shape to a large degree our thinking, perceptions, values, and needs. In other words, they change <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">what experiences we find meaningful and why</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"2927\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The AI researchers were stubborn, however. Granted, they were one of the smartest and most creative technical people in the world and philosophy hasn’t really solved those questions for two thousand years, so their confidence wasn’t unwarranted. They did propose a purely technical solution to the problem of context and relevancy, which Dreyfus named <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">a frame problem</em>. They said something along the lines: If the context defines the function and meaning of objects, it would be enough to generate a list of all possible contexts and what’s relevant for them. The AI algorithms will have a list where a context, for example, named “kitchen” has programmed all possible related objects and actions that are meaningful to think of in the kitchen. With enough computational power, the more items may be added to the list. It was a matter of faster processors and more memory.</p>\n<p id=\"70dd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Yet, Dreyfus replied that it’s not really a solution to the frame problem at all, because it only moves the problem one level up. Now, it was necessary to decide not the choice of what objects and actions are relevant within a recognized context, but what features of the scene are relevant to choosing the relevant context. We need to recognize the “meta-context” to define the context. It’s an infinite regress.</p>\n<p id=\"38eb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How does the frame problem solve human beings? We have the advantage of being already embodied and situated in a context that we don’t need to represent it in our heads. In fact, the world we are surrounded by <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">is the representation of its own</em>. Put it differently, we don’t need to look at the environment, then create a map of it and see it only through this map. We simply just look at the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"7668\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But how do we see the environment and where do we get the relevancy? If we are more or less practical creatures, our perception of the world should reflect that. According to Heidegger, our practical ways of being also mean <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">we perceive things practically </em>through what we can do with them. We look at things as equipment whose an important attribute is that it is always for something, or as Heidegger says, “in-order-to”. Furthermore, there are two ways we approach objects in our environment. The first, less common one, is there are objects we see through the scientific lens. We observe their properties, shape, colour, material and so on. Whereas such looking at things belongs to the core values of scientific inquiry, our everyday experiences look differently. Rarely do we put science glasses on, we use the second way to look at things instead: we just use things according to what they offer us to do based on the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"a65f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Heidegger, Dreyfus and other phenomenologically influenced researchers propose something even more radical. According to them, we don’t see things as they are at all, what we perceive is their meanings and functions, which can be translated to the modern design language as <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">that we do not perceive things as such, we just see their affordances.</em></p>\n<p id=\"2a06\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What is an affordance? The neologism that almost all people in UX/HCI community have heard of, but the exact reason for the popularity is clouded in a semi-mystery. We may find the original definitions of affordances in the work of the famous ecological psychologist J. J. Gibson who coined the term. He said that there are things in our environment that have objective and perceivable qualities that <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">afford </em>humans<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> </em>certain actions.</p>\n<p id=\"7506\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The murkiness of affordances will surface only after we start reading the original works of Gibson and the commentary by Norman and others. Gibson said that we can perceive affordances directly, we just “pick them up” from the environment. At the same time, he suggests that affordances are relative to the given organism (Gibson didn’t specifically write about the perception of humans) and can be shared among the members if they live in the same ecological niche. When I read these passages, I was confused because it contradicts the previous claim that affordances are so easy to recognize that we just need to see them. But seeing, as Gibson admits, turns out to be more complicated than that. And it makes sense. Do ants see differently from humans? Of course. Does M.I.T. student with a Ph.D. in quantum computing sees the graphical interface of e-shop differently from a child? Probably. Will AI robots experience the world differently (if they experience it at all) compared to humans? The answer is already easy to guess. Yes, because their ecological niche (context) and physical attributes (bodies) are different. Then, affordances don’t seem that fixed and direct anymore. Don Norman himself agrees. Rather than static qualities of environment and objects, affordances are relationships between the environment and organism. They are both situated in the physical environment but also inside the cognitive abilities, knowledge, emotional states of the organism.</p>\n<p id=\"8162\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">These days designers who read about affordances think of them in the Gibsonian sense. While Gibson believed, despite his inconsistencies that affordances are “out there” to be picked up without any effort; Norman recently claims, however, this is not true. Affordances must be interpreted first and the ease of interpretation is relative. Affordances of things can be so easy to spot that we perceive them as transparent; on the other hand, some affordances are not transparent and self-explanatory at all, especially when things break down. Their affordances then seem more opaque and we have to make a conscious effort to determine what’s going on.</p>\n<p id=\"8723\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The interpretation can happen immediately. For example, as you meet one of your friends on the street coming your way, you won’t process his face step by step to recognize him, the facial recognition happens in an instance. However, if the following day you briefly spot the same friend from the car, not knowing if it was her or not, suddenly you’ll begin to go through the list of details you remember that you saw: the hair, the gait, the clothing the person wore etc. The ease of interpreting the very same person depends on the context of the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"946b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To give another example. While reading a good novel or short story, the words and sentences flow, we are transfixed by the sounds and images that the skilled author evokes in our mind through the medium of writing. Yet the same text doesn’t suddenly produce the same effects if we read it when we are sick with flu or just experienced a divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"2b9c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How we interpret certain things is heavily influenced by our state of mind which itself depends on the contextual factors we find ourselves in. Our “reading” of things, objects, tools and their meanings is historically, culturally and socially conditioned, which I find useful to call <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">the broader context; </em>and also conditioned by the immediate situation we are in, for which I tend to use the term <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">the situational context</em>. Although there may be other approaches to distinguish between types of context, designers should think of how dynamic and far-reaching the give contextual factors are and how they affect design choices. The broader context takes its name from historical, cultural, social and perhaps even developmental factors of a person. These influences are “broad” in time and space. On the other hand, the situational context suggests the influence of the space we occupy <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">at the moment</em>. Speaking as a digital designer, the broader context defines what gender or nationality we select in the registration form, whereas the situational context provides information to a mobile application whether it should warn us about traffic jams in next minutes or later.</p>\n<h4 id=\"b705\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Lucy Suchman and situated actions</h4>\n<p id=\"3476\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The situational context was explored more in depth by the anthropologist and feminist theoretician Lucy Suchman. In her doctoral dissertation and following book <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Plans and situated actions: The Problem of Human-Machine Communicatio</em>n, she studied how users struggled with a professional copy-printer machine. Her observations led her to criticize the cognitivist dogma that humans think, act and interact with technology according to the predefined plans.</p>\n<p id=\"6077\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To the contrary, Suchman says that interaction with technology resembles a two-way communication and the predefined plan merely acts as a boilerplate for establishing it. The real actions, however, emerge only during the very act of interacting with technology when a user adapts and changes her behaviour in relation to the physical and social needs and “situational context”. According to Suchman’s research, the real interaction with technology looks like ad hoc improvisation, taking advantage of tools and other resources at hand to satisfy the current needs.</p>\n<p id=\"65bb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">While cognitivism looks at the world as a static background for which the fixed plans make sense, using the research methods from ethnomethodology, Suchman showed that we constantly update and adapt to a given situation. Paul Dourish commented that Suchman “presented a model of interaction with the world in which the apparently objective phenomena of the cognitivist model were, instead, active interpretations of the world formed in response to specific settings and circumstances (Dourish, 2001, s. 72).</p>\n<p id=\"cea1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Humans don’t follow algorithms in everyday tasks, as cognitivism wanted us to believe. Suchman suggests that we should think of our acts and thinking as being ad hoc, improvised, in other words, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">situated</em>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"0ea3\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Tacit knowledge</h4>\n<p id=\"0dde\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">While working on my thesis, I gradually started to get more often the feeling that I have already read what I was reading at the time, even though the book or article was unrelated. Or at least seemingly unrelated. What started as a boring history of an obscure HCI field, it became much larger than I expected. The HCI suddenly looked like a melting pot of the most significant and exciting new ideas.</p>\n<p id=\"0525\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For example, the just finished section on Lucy Suchman gave me a pointer to another broad subject. Because if people don’t follow rules that much and they basically improvise when they work and solve everyday problems, new ways of doing things start to emerge around the context and will become a new micro-culture or <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">community of practice</em></a>.</p>\n<p id=\"6350\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Of course, we know it first hand. Designers and programmers we work with have specialized vocabularies that the outside community of people don’t know. If a person, outsider wants to cooperate with them, the acquisition of the specialized vocabulary is oftentimes a prerequisite not only for understanding but also gaining a respect that enables one to “fit in” the particular culture.</p>\n<p id=\"87d0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Some parts of the vocabulary and ways of doing can be explained easily to people. When a person is confused why programmers “push” something so often, there are many written instructions how a person can learn about the GIT versioning ecosystem. If a Martian visited the planet Earth and wanted to know the meaning of kicking the ball into nets between goalposts, it’s easy to say that the more you can kick the ball to the opposite net, the better chance you have to win the game.</p>\n<p id=\"8ffa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But suppose the Martian is intrigued by football (soccer for the US readers) and want to know the best way to kick the ball, or how to ride the bicycle or play the violoncello. Suddenly, the verbal explanation is not sufficient. You really have to show and let the Martian observe your moves so she can get a grasp of how to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"0d5f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In fact, what I am alluding here too is the realization by Michael Polanyi in 1958 that there are two types of knowledge. The first one is the knowledge of dates, names and other factual information. It’s the knowledge of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">what</em> that can be explicitly stated verbally. The other type of knowledge is more of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">how </em>to do things, which are difficult to just describe and in order to learn it we have to immerse ourselves in the practice and experience it first hand.</p>\n<p id=\"5efa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It is the “how” knowledge that Polanyi called <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">tacit knowledge </em>because it cannot be stated explicitly. And it is this type of knowledge that is crucial to managers or designers and at the same time hard to obtain because the people who can do various things are not necessarily capable of explaining them themselves. Most of the time, explaining it in words doesn’t make sense. How do we describe how to learn to swim or how do we hit a nail with a hammer? We can philosophize about such things endlessly, but only after we do these things and gain sufficient experience in doing them, will we “get” it.</p>\n<p id=\"4250\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For designers, the tacit knowledge poses a challenge. If they want to design something useful and meaningful for a certain community of people, to know how those people actually behave and think is essential. Yet if some knowledge is tacit, the only way to get a grasp of it is by observation and interpretation. The question of tacit knowledge and community of specific practice mean that observing people and interpreting what they do in their everyday context is a necessary tool in the designer’s repertoire. Here, it starts to make sense why the anthropologist Lucy Suchman was interested in how people interact with technology. As an anthropologist, she had all the necessary methods and tools to observe and interpret the situated actions and practices. And she argued that exactly those tools and methods from her field, as well as sociology and others, should become a standard toolkit for designers who care about whether their work produces functional and meaningful <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">experiences</em>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"b235\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Embodied cognition</h4>\n<p id=\"712e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Moreover, the tacit knowledge is related to “embodied cognition” which was the topic mentioned by the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus. Eleanor Rosch and her colleagues explain the ideas behind the “embodiment thesis” as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"8830\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\"><p>“By using the term embodied we mean to highlight two points: first that cognition depends upon the kinds of experience that come from having a body with various [bodily] capacities, and second, that these individual [capacities] are themselves embedded in a more encompassing biological, psychological and cultural context”      (Source: Eleanor Rosch et al.: The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience pages 172–173)</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"da2e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">If the tacit knowledge depends on our bodies to express certain knowledge (playing the violoncello), it means this knowledge is not, under the cognitivist paradigm, representable (only) symbolically. It requires a kind of body similar to our human one so that it can play the violoncello as humans would do. Incidentally, it also falsifies the idea that everything we need for thinking is inside our heads.</p>\n<p id=\"baab\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Margaret Wilson summarizes research on how the mind is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">embodied</em> in her article <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Six views of Embodied cognition.</em></p>\n<ol class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"0bfd\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Cognition is situated</strong>: We already know the importance of the situational context from the anthropological research.

One of the cores of the research in embodied cognition is to find out how our bodies influence now and even historically our cognition. George Lakoff is one of the main researchers arguing that our language and even mathematics are essentially based on the metaphorical understanding of the world through the lens of our bodies. For example, the adverbs “in front of” or “up” are basic metaphors related to the position of our body in relation to the world. The same applies to mathematics with numbers as a metaphor for physical objects in the world and mathematical sets as containers for these objects.</li>\n<li id=\"4bb4\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">The environment is part of the cognitive system: </strong>The last point is the most controversial one. Wilson says that the information flow between mind and world is so dense and continuous that rather than study our cognitive activity doesn’t come from the mind alone, but is a combination of the mind and the environmental situation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p id=\"8e26\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Proponents of the theories like <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">extended and distributed mind</em> agree with the sixth point. They argue that our mind and thinking “leak” into our environment, making the environmental context an important part of our behaviour and decision-making. It makes sense to explore what they have to say about how we think.</p>\n<h4 id=\"3718\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Extended and distributed cognition</h4>\n<p id=\"984c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">This may be embarrassing, but I have to ask you anyway: do you remember the phone number of your partner? At least your father, grandmother, no? Why should you, the world is a complex place filled with other things to remember, therefore if you can “outsource” some parts of your memory to smart devices like iPhones or iPad, you happily do so.</p>\n<p id=\"76cc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But according to philosophers Andy Clark, David Chalmers or cognitive psychologist Edwin Hutchins and other researchers, it is becoming increasingly useful to look at our relationship with technological artifacts as a philosophical issue with real consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"c944\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The more we are surrounded by technology, the more we off-load our cognitive tasks to our gadgets, making them a part of our extended mind. Researchers and theories suggest that our brain is in fact just a part of an extended, distributed cognitive system that consists of people, artifacts, and environment.</p>\n<p id=\"9d52\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Andy Clark and David Chalmers argue for this position in their famous article “The Extended Mind” written in 1998. In the text they propose a thought experiment to show how the environment could play a part of our cognition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"1e50\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><p>The fictional characters Otto and Inga are both travelling to a museum simultaneously. Otto has <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor\" title=\"Alzheimer's disease\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease\">Alzheimer’s disease</a>, and has written all of his directions down in a notebook to serve the function of his memory. Inga is able to recall the internal directions within her memory. In a traditional sense, Inga can be thought to have had a belief as to the location of the museum before consulting her memory. In the same manner, Otto can be said to have held a belief of the location of the museum before consulting his notebook. The argument is that the only difference existing in these two cases is that Inga’s memory is being internally processed by the brain, while Otto’s memory is being served by the notebook. In other words, Otto’s mind has been extended to include the notebook as the source of his memory. The notebook qualifies as such because it is constantly and immediately accessible to Otto, and it is automatically endorsed by him.(Source: <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Extended_Mind\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Extended_Mind\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Extended_Mind</a>)</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b062\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">The authors go even further and ask if the culture and society might play the similar role in extending our cognition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"7920\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\"><p>“And what about socially-extended cognition? Could my mental states be partly constituted by the states of other thinkers? We see no reason why not, in principle.”</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"23e5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Although this idea was introduced in the West by Andy Clark and David Chalmers, the HCI/UX researchers Victor Kaptelinin and Bonnie Nardi give us in their book <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Acting with Technology Activity Theory and Interaction Design </em>enough information to see that similar ideas were developed already by the Soviet psychologist <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural-historical_psychology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural-historical_psychology\">Lev Vygotsky</a> and his circle of scientists as a part of the Soviet programme to counter the Western, “bourgeois” science and to include as much as social and cultural influences on our cognition as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"bdb1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I don’t see Clark and Chalmers as being driven by pro-Stalinist or Marxist ideology, so it seems to me that Vygotsky was really ahead of times and rather modern, introducing the concept of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">cultural-historical psychology</em> that argues that we cannot separate mind, brain, and culture. For Vygotsky, it was very important to emphasize two things about the impact of culture and society on human beings.</p>\n<p id=\"7a32\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">First, culture and society are not external to us, but rather shape directly our mind. At the same time, Vygotsky was not a cultural determinist as many left-leaning people today are. Even inside the Soviet regime, Vygotsky maintained that the relationship between individual’s mind and culture and society was interactive, dialectic, the influence went both ways.</p>\n<p id=\"f6ac\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The second (and for designers) perhaps a more interesting theory that Vygotsky wrote about was the importance of tools for higher psychological functions. As Kaptelinin and Nardi remind us in their book, human beings don’t interact with the world directly these days. We have developed technology and technological tools that <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">mediate</em> our relationship with the world. Vygotsky argued that in addition to the physical tools like hammers, we are also equipped with symbolic cultural artifacts, or “psychological tools” such as texts, algebraic notations or most importantly, language. As Kaptelinin and Nardi write, Vygotsky initially didn’t make the distinction between physical psychological; hammers, maps, and algebraic notation were the same for him. Later on, he observed that people stopped using the physical tool and relied only on the internalized functions or “psychological tools” in their heads.</p>\n<p id=\"3cb2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The point is subtle, but it means that through technology we internalize ways of thinking and solving problems that we otherwise wouldn’t be able to do so. According to Vygotsky, technology actively shapes our thinking. This view is not foreign to other theories. Distribution cognition theories explicitly state that technological artifacts, human beings, and environment are all parts of the distributed cognitive system. Embodied cognition adds that our bodies and interacting with the world are essential for our cognition as well.</p>\n<p id=\"ec24\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There were followers of Vygotsky led by another Soviet psychologist, Alexei Leont’ev who developed Vygotsky’s idea to the whole new theory — activity theory—, which puts even a strong emphasis on the role that technological artifacts play in shaping how we think, act and find things meaningful. The unit of analysis in activity theory is an activity and how tools mediate the interaction between the human and object or goal of what she tries to accomplish.</p>\n<p id=\"4918\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">According to activity theory, distributed cognition and even current research in postphenomenological philosophy of technology, our technological tools aren’t neutral nor merely instrumental. By using our tools we shape our ourselves, culture and society. Consequently, our culture and society also shape back our tools. Technological artifacts, therefore, carry with themselves cultural and social layers as the inevitable reflection of the fact that technology doesn’t exist in the vacuum, but is created by designers and engineers in a specific socio-cultural context.</p>\n<h4 id=\"60e2\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">The summary of the fall of cognitivism</h4>\n<p id=\"5486\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The previous sections show that we recognize things (tools, objects, technology) and affordances according to their meanings and functions that help us solve our daily tasks and needs. The meanings and functions themselves are results of our active interpretation of the world within broader and situational contexts, as I named them previously. The context has multiple connected layers and it’s technically impossible to make a list of all the ways we can interpret things around us. Fortunately for us humans, we have inbuilt ways to filter out what is meaningful and relevant to us. These mechanisms are not magical, instead, they are based on the fact that we are embodied creatures living in the world. Our culture, society, biology, body, and situations we are in always reduce the infinite ways of how to act into something manageable. Based on who we are, the world is presented to us as a set of potential actions or affordances we can exploit to solve our practical tasks and needs.</p>\n<p id=\"588a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As for the criticism of cognitivism, humans are not information-processing units, nor digital computers with fixed rules or algorithms that govern our thinking. The world is in a constant flux and we have to creatively adapt to it. We don’t behave scientifically, as objective observers detached from the world. On the contrary, we are deeply involved with the world. To reduce its complexity, we solve our daily problems practically, according to what we find meaningful and suitable to our needs. The environment provides us with potential affordances which we may or may not exploit based on the situational and broader context of the interaction with tools, objects, and technology that are part of what theoreticians call our broader cognitive system. The coupling of tools, environment and ourselves means that we don’t rely only on what is inside our head, as cognitivism suggested, but actively use all the resources around us to get where we want to be.</p>\n<p id=\"460b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Additionally, my brief discussion of embodied knowledge, theories of extended or distributed mind and a mentioning of basic ideas in activity theory should help us realize that technology is not passive, neutral or merely instrumental helping us solve our needs. Technology is ubiquitous in our lives and stands between us and the world as a medium. As I discussed with the work of Vygotsky and activity theory, technology is a tool that mediates our relationship to the world and actively shapes our thinking. Technology therefore not only carries layers of culture and society where it was created but also, through the mechanism of a feedback loop, itself changes to culture and society.</p>\n<p id=\"51e3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Two main lessons can be drawn from the critique of cognitivism. First, contextual factors that were overlooked by cognitivism are immensely important for what we find useful and meaningful and how we experience the world.</p>\n<p id=\"4f3c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The second, our relationship to technology is much more complex than many think. If technology influences our thinking, culture, and society, we better Designers must be informed about these points.</p>\n<p id=\"e60c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">I will discuss these topics separately in next posts that will treat in-depth what happened after the fall of cognitivism in HCI, what the role of context started to be. That will be a useful preparation to eventually jump into the most difficult, yet exciting questions about the philosophy of interface as the unique relationship between technology and society where the depth and the surface meet.</p>\n<p><em>The article for originally written for and published on my <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jakub_ferenc/i-read-a-lot-of-academic-literature-on-ux-hci-heres-what-it-says-part-i-4acb2c4339f8\">Medium blog</a>. </em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>HCI is where design, cognitive science, philosophy, culture, and society meet at the interface.

Human-computer interaction field has been since its inception influenced heavily by cognitive science and its paradigm of &#8222;cognitivism&#8220; that views the human mind through the metaphor of a computer processor, more specifically as an information-processing unit. However cognitivism as a paradigm has been attacked by many. For example, Hubert Dreyfus, Lucy Suchman and Terry Winograd with Fernando Flores wrote important works criticizing cognitivism and its lacking conceptions of context, society, culture and in general &#8222;being-in-the-world&#8220; that are, nevertheless, crucial in interpreting everyday&#8217;s actions of human beings.</p>\n<p>The books presents the overview of cognitivism, followed by individual postcognitivistic approaches such as embodied/extended/enactive/distributed mind or activity theory. All of them share the view that to understand interaction with technology, we need to deal with contextual factors. Moreover, they all agree that technology plays an important part in our coping with everyday situations and mediating our relation with the world. Technology in the view of postcognitivistic approaches is not a passive brick sitting on our tables, but something that actively shapes our minds and thinking. It enables us to do things otherwise inconceivable for us.</p>\n<p>Overall, Phil Turner wrote the book that is a primer for anyone who starts or is already deeply focused on the theoretical approaches to HCI. The HCI fields is becoming truly important, because in the age of ubiquitous computing, internet of things, information and network society, we are immersed in technology with computational capabilities and interfaces. Human-computer interaction therefore has become something of &#8222;human-technology-world&#8220; interaction. And for such a leap, new paradigms are needed. Technology is deeply interwoven into our lives, therefore it seems that HCI field starts to become a universal lens through which we can analyze society and humanity at large. Philosophers and theoreticians such as Gilbert Simondon, Vilém Flusser or recently Benjamin Bratton argued forcefully that to analyze society, traditional methods in sociology are no longer sufficient, because increasingly humans interact more with technology than other humans, or the human-human interaction is almost always mediated by technology. To understand our society, we need to understand our relation to technology.

Tezí jeho knihy je silné tvrzení, že nežijeme vedle nebo pouze s technologiemi a médii, ale že </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">žijeme uvnitř médií</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Média jsou v dnešním Západním světě všudypřítomná a všeprostupující. Deuze nabádá, abychom akceptovali fakt, že naše společnost je plně mediatizovaná a začali chápat vztah člověka a technologií právě touto optikou. To ale znamená, že technologický a sociální determinismus nejsou vhodné nástroje, jak se na mediatizovanou společnost dívat, neboť implicitně předpokládají, že technologie stojí mimo společnosti a zcela determinuje její chod, jak to vidíme v případě technologického determinismu, respektive, že společnost má zcela pod kontrolou technologii a že nedochází ke zpětnému ovlivňování sociální sféry technologiemi, jak by tvrdil sociální a kulturní determinismus. Deuze poznamenává, že žádný ze zmíněných determinismů řádně neosvětluje skutečný vztah člověka a technologie, který se spíše než prvenstvím jednoho před druhým vyznačuje vzájemnou závislostí. Deuze s mnoha dalšími citovanými teoretiky se přiklání k neodlučnosti sociálního a technologického. Média jsou sociotechnickým tkanivem našich životů, které nelze odstranit a odolává všem shanám o svou likvidaci, jak komentuje Petříček, “jsme odsouzeni ke zprostředkovanosti” (Petříček, 2008, s. 13) Přijímání médií je usnadněno tím, že se nám postupně vytrácejí z našeho fenomenologického vnímání každodennosti. Stávají se pro nás neviditelnými a vždy po ruce, což je jeden z cílů přístupů všudypřítomné a ambientí výpočetní techniky, ale zároveň se tím prohlubuje naše nevědomost o tom, co s námi média dělají. Stávají se černou skříňkou, do které většina společnosti nevidí. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uniká nám to, na co již upozorňoval Simondon se svým konceptem technicity: média jsou součástí rozsáhlé technologické infrastruktury další objektů a procesů, které nejsme s to vnímat. Podle čtení Flussera (Flusser, 2013) se vytváří nová nerovnost ve společnosti, která připomíná rozštěp mezi analfabetickou veřejností a intelektuální elitou ztělesněnou církví, která uměla číst dominantní kód tehdejší doby: abecedu. Především katolická církev a knežská gramotná elita se staly pro zbytek společnosti </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">médiem</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> mezi Bohem a pozemským životem. Kněží vykládali svět a jejich interpretace světa ovlivnila životy mnoha lidí. Po matematizaci společnosti započatou Galileem a rozvedenou Descartesem, pro které svět byl velká kniha psaná jazykem matematiky, se postupně dominantním kódem stává právě matematika. Ti, kteří jí ovládají, jsou novými vykladači světa, protože disponují modely pro predikci a vysvětlení toho, jak svět funguje. Přestože Flusser nekomentoval rozmach sítě sítí internet, mým názorem je, že jeho myšlenky v době všudypřítomné výpočetní techniky, mobilních aplikací a debaty o tom, že programování by se mělo stát novým typem povinné gramotnosti, jsou stále, ne-li více platné. Lidé, kteří umí matematizovat a algoritmizovat přirodní i sociální svět, jsou novými médii a vykladači světa, nahrává jim v tom změna paradigmat, kdy jsme se od teologie přesunuli k scientismu a materialismu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelze však očekávat, že celá společnost se bude skládat pouze z vědců, matematiků či programátorů, jak si představoval například jeden z moderních praotců dystopického románu Yevgeny Zamyatin ve svém díle My. Věda i matematika se naučily zpřístupňovat své výsledky veřejnosti pomocí popularizačních článků a knihu. Jakou formu popularizace lze nalézt ve Světě médií? Kognitivní semiotik Göran Sonesson poznamenává podobně jako Mark Deuze, že dnešní běžný život je hluboce mediovaný neviditelnými médii, které “se ztrácejí v přirozených uživatelských rozhraních [interface]” a “vytrácejí [se] coby infrastruktury každodenních interakcí” (Deuze, 2015, s. 169). Zatímco sociologické studie vidí novomediální technologii optikou sociálně-kulturního determinismu jako produkt nebo rozšíření sociálních vazeb (Gane, 2006, s. 33), sociolog Nicholas Gane se v duchu této diplomové práce ptá, zdali v dnešní síťové, informační společnosti a plně mediatizované společnosti založené na rychlosti a distribuovaných vztazích napříč časoprostorem plní sociologie svou úlohu, pokud se zaměřuje pouze na lidské vztahy. Stejnou otázku si klade fenomenologicky orientovaný filosof komunikace Vilém Flusser ve svém díle </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do univerza technických obrazů</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Pro Flussera technické obrazy neodrážejí jako zrcadla nějakou již existující realitu, ale aktivně konstruují nové významy a realitu na “klamné povrchy”, která příjemcům navrhují způsob života. Tím se mění společenská struktura, kterou klasická sociologie vycházející od člověka nemůže podle Flussera vhodně postihnout, není platná pro společnost, v jejíž středu nestojí lidé, ale technické obrazy a vztahy mezi technických obrazem a člověkem, které se stávají “centrálním problémem každé budoucí kulturní kritiky a všechny ostatní problémy se musí uchopovat odtud” (Flusser, 2001, s. 51). Gane proto navrhuje, že by se sociologie pro porozumění dnešního Světa médií měla možná zaměřit na “[interface] mezi lidmi a technologiemi a [&#8230;] na jeh[o] radikální transformativní sílu” (Gane, 2006, s. 32-33).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shakespeare možná kdysi napsal, že celý svět je jeviště. Sociolog Erving Goffman souhlasil, když ve svém díle do češtiny přeloženém jako </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Všichni hrajeme divadlo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Goffman, 1999) koncipoval společnost prostřednictvím interagujících lidí-herců, kteří v zákulisí mohou mít různé persony, ale na veřejnost (jevišti) nastavují svou “fasádu” na základě toho, jaké signály chtějí v dané sociální situaci vysílat. Goffman píše, že fasáda je nutnou podmínkou započetní interakce, a jakmile jednou si pro dnaou sociální situaci člověk ustanoví fasádu, snaží se podstoupit takové akce, které jsou konzistentní s jeho fasádou; těm, které by jí ohrožovaly, se snaží vyhnout nebo jinak se vůči nim vymezit (Goffman, 2016). Fasáda se podle Goffmana “institucionalizuje do podoby abstraktního stereotypního očekávání, které vzbuzuje” (Goffman, 1999), což se analogicky podobá zažitým designovým vzorům, o kterých psal Christopher Alexander. Fasáda plní úkoly relevantní pro daný moment, zároveň ale postupně nabývá na významu a stabilitě a stává se “kolektivní reprezentací [a] plnoprávnou skutečností” (Goffman, 1999, s. 33). V době internetu věcí a všudypřítomné výpočetní techniky se podle teoretiků nových médií Boltera a Grusina ve svět transformuje spíše než na jeviště na jeden velký počítačový interface (Bolter a Grusin, 1999, s. 196). Koncept fasády je pro analýzu mezilidské komunikace stále v určité míře platný, avšak dvě nové změny se objevily </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">na scéně</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: fasáda člověka je nyní mediována a ovlivňována technologií; za druhé se objevila nová fasáda v podobě </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interface</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> technologií.

Byl jsem schopný napsat desítky stránek slohového cvičení a přes zjevné nedostatky v gramatice jsem se věnoval pečlivé analýze psychologických charakteristik svých postav, jejichž příběh a akce jsem sice viděl ve své představivosti, ale netušil jsem nic o jejich povaze. Právě tuto pečlivost k detailnímu vyprávění a touhu dobrat se správného popisu postav na základě mentální představy považuji retrospektivně za znak určitého talentu, zvláště když jsem v ostatních akademických předmětech nedosahoval srovnatelného hodnocení ani potěšení z pracovního procesu či dokončení.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Důležitý zvrat na mé cestě za kreativitou nastal při náhodném zakoupení knihy </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Úplně nová mysl</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Pink, 2008)</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> s </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">podtitulem </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proč budoucnost patří pravým hemisférám</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">od amerického autora Daniela H. Pinka. Přestože se kniha svou formou zaměřuje na popularizaci serióznějšího výzkumu a propaguje koncepty a teorie, které se z dnešního pohledu jeví jako nesprávné či nepřesné (například emoční inteligence či že IQ hraje jen 4-10% roli v úspěchu v zaměstnání), byla pro mě prvním seznámeném s myšlenkami obhajujícími, proč je kreativita kritickou lidskou dovedností pro nadcházející společenské i ekonomické změny. Pink v knize zmiňuje, že zatímco v současné době žijeme v době informační, ve které dominují analytické schopnosti a které ztělesňují povolání jako právníci, programátoři nebo účetní, budoucnost podle něj patří kreativním lidem, kteří dokáží myslet systémově, brát v potaz širší kontext a kromě tvrdých analytických dat se dokáží vypořádat s nejistými a chaotickými podmínkami sociálních systémů, kde je třeba použít intuice, estetického cítění a empatie. Tyto lidé jsou navíc ze své povahy otevřeni novým zkušenostem, a tím lépe adaptováni na nastávající změny v ekonomice, které Pink předznamenával již před deseti lety jako změny související s outsourcingem do asijských zemí, automatizací pomocí robotizace a také kultury nadbytku, kdy Západní svět již nemusí řešit nedostatek materiálních prostředků, ale uchyluje se naopak k uspokojení dalšího patra Maslowy pyramidy, konkrétně k uspokojení zážitkových a estetických potřeb. Důraz na kreativitu, empatii a systémové myšlení jakožto protiváha k outsourcingu, automatizaci a nadbytku jsou pro Pinka natolik odlišné proměnné rozhodující o ekonomickém a společenském úspěchu, že se uchýlil k tomu tyto změny označit jako konstitující novou éru, kterou se posouváme z doby informační do doby </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">koncepční</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Čím se Pinkova kniha pro mě stala ještě zajímavější je její koncept dívat se na dobu informační a dobu koncepční, na analýzu a syntézu jako na binární opozice, které mohou mít i neurobiologický základ v podobě dvou mozkových hemisfér. Pink zmiňuje výzkumu syndromu oddělených hemisfér Rogera Sperryho a jeho následující aplikaci Betty Edwardsovou v knize </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kreslení pravou mozkovou hemisférou</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, ve které se Edwardsová snaží učit kresbu tím, že představuje speciálně navržené metody kreslení, díky kterým člověk “utiší” levou hemisféru, a naopak aktivuje více hemisféru pravou. Zatímco Edwardsová explicitně vychází z výzkumu o laterizaci určitých kognitivních schopností do jedné či druhé hemisféry, kde například levá hemisféra je řečena jako více analytická, verbální a sekveční, kdežto pravá je více holistická, vizuální a tedy více zastupuje dovednosti vhodné ke kreativitě, Pink tento výzkum cituje, ale i  když čtenář i  současná věda striktně binární laterizaci odmítají, jedná se aspoň o potentní metaforu, která zaštiťuje celý narativ knihy Ať už jsou konkrétní kognitivní schopnosti lokalizovány v mozku kdekoli, nepodrývá to příliš Pinkovu tezi, že kreativita je dovednost kritická pro ekonomiku 21. století.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jak se kniha podepsala na mém pohledu na kreativitu? v první řadě jsem si začal své, jakkoli limitované kreativity vážit. Dále jsem přijal Pinkovu tezi o budoucím vlivu kreativních povolání a rozhodl se svou kreativitu trénovat mnoha způsoby, abych byl na potenciální změny pracovního trhu připravený: od docházení na kurzy kreslení až po cílené vyhledávání činností nebo momentů, které byly pro mě nové, a tak vyžadovaly k vyřešení tvořivější přístup k řešení problémů. Vyhledávání nových, pro mě jako introvertně založeného člověka nepříjemných okamžiků určitě pomohlo stimulovat mou mysl různorodými podněty a postupně mi nové, nejasné a chaotické situace vadily méně a v pracovním životě jsem je dokonce vyhledával častěji, neboť jsem zjistil, že mnou navrhovaná kreativní řešení se častokrát uchytila. To mi dodalo sebevědomí se pokusit o změnu pracovního místa. Postupně jsem se začal orientovat na kreativní aspekty práce v oboru informačních technologií, konkrétně jsem se z pozice programátora přeorientoval na pozici designéra, která mi dávala možnost o projektech přemýšlet nejen z pohledu toho, jak vyřešit daný technický problém, ale také jsem rozpoznal důležitost i zájem přemýšlet nad projektem z pozice budoucích uživatelů. Ptal jsem se nejen, jak určité věci je možné udělat, ale zaobíral jsem se pro mě čím dál důležitější otázkou, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proč</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> věci dělat právě daným způsobem a jaký smysl, hodnotu a naplnění z projektu budou budoucí uživatele mít. Pozice designéra mě v posledních letech zavedla k nutnosti přemýšlet nad problémy systémově, neboť aspoň z pohledu problémů, které designér řeší, se zdá zjevné, že jednotlivé problémy nelze řešit izolovaně, ale je nutné se na ně dívat jako na menší součásti většího systému, kdy systémem myslím především vztah sociálních, kulturních, geografických, historických vlivů a kontextů.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zájem o kultivaci kreativity ve mně pěstoval i zájem o intelektuální dědictví umělců, spisovatelů nebo teoretiků píšících o umění, ve kterých jsem především hledal určitý návod, jednoduchý postup, jak zlepšit svou kreativní produkci. Více znalostí totiž s sebou přináší negativní stránku v podobě strachu z toho, že mnohé už vytvořeno bylo a určité egoistické žárlení na všechny již etablované umělce a kreativce všeho druhu, s jejichž tvorbou a talentem se člověk musí vypořádat, neb si nevěří, což často vede k určité tvořivostní úzkosti z toho číst či znát předchozí umělce, ale zároveň jimi nebýt ovlivněn do takové míry, aby vlastní díla byla pouze zjevným derivátem již existujícího. Na poli poezie o této </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">úzkosti z ovlivnění</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> psal v knize </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(česky vyšlo v roce 2015 jako Úzkost z ovlivnění: Teorie poezie) americko-židovský literární kritik Harold Bloom (Bloom, 2015).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vyzkoušel jsem několik výrazových prostředků tvořivosti. Od zmíněné kresby, u které jsem se nejvíce trápil, po snad až příliš krátké koketování s klavírem, když jsem docházel na hodiny k Janu Bartošovi. Nakonec jsem se začátkem univerzitních studií obloukem vrátil k pokusům o literární tvorbu, u které jsem zůstal doposud a přijde mi jako nejpřirozenější médium pro mé kreativně-umělecké ambice a potřeby.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V zimním semestru 2017/2018 jsem začal v rámci započetí studia Kognitivní informatiky na VŠE docházet na předmět </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kognitivní psychologie a tvořivost v informatice</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Měl jsem od předmětu velká očekávání a možná i proto jsem byl nakonec lehce zklamaný. Počítal jsem s tím, že si na předmětu prohloubím znalosti toho, jak kreativitu vidí kognitivní věda, jaké jsou současné teorie kreativity a která má v současném výzkumu největší podporu apod. Teorii předmět zmiňoval, bylo jí věnováno hodina a půl z tříhodinového bloku, ale na můj vkus se pohybovala pouze po povrchu problémů, nešla tak do hloubky, jak jsem očekával, což ale bylo zapřičiněno nejspíše tím, že předmět měl být především vstupní branou všem novým zájemcům o kreativitu nahlíženou psychologicko-kognitivním prizmatem. Pro nově příchozí k této problematice si dokážu představit, že předmět byl přínosnějším.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naopak mě pozitivně překvapilo praktické zaměření seminární části předmětu, kde vyučující po studentech vyžadovala, aby látku probíranou během přednášek zkusili aplikovat na své životy. Pro praktickou část předmětu jsem měl příležitost napsat esej, jejíž cílem bylo popsat pokus vystoupit z komfortní zóny, pomyslné konceptuální krabice a zažít v životě něco, co by atakovalo vše, co je pro mě přirozené a psychologicky bezpečné. Toto nevinné cvičení vedlo k jednomu z nejdůležitějších momentů mého života, protože psaní eseje koincidovalo s právě probíhajícími zvraty v osobním životě, a tak jich využil jako materiálu pro esej, ve které jsem popsal své dlouhodobé psychologické, osobní a rodinné problémy, jejichž pouhé vyslovení pro mě donedávna nepřekročitelný problém. Přestože můj výstup z komfortní zóny nepředstavoval klasický čin spojený s uměleckou nebo kreativní tvorbou, ve svém případě jsem se postavil největšímu nepříteli, který představovala má hlava. Jelikož kreativita vyžaduje schopnost čelit těžkým, zdánlivě neřešitelným problémům a otázkám, myslím, že jsem byl v právu, když jsem zadání pojal jako boj se sebou samým. Samotné napsání eseje znamenalo součást mé osobní terapie, takže i když esej pojednávala o již proběhlých událostech, její odevzdání bylo také vystoupením z komfortní zóny. Konsekvence tohoto činu již nyní mají enormní vliv a budu dělat vše, abych na svůj záblesk odvahy dokázal plnohodnotně a kontinuálně navazovat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V přítomnosti a blízké budoucnosti plánuji navázat na pravidelné vystupování z komfortní zóny, které mi dovoluje poznat sebe samého z dosud neviděných úhlů, čímž si rozšiřuji znalosti toho, čeho jsem ve skutečnosti schopný. Konkrétněji bych opouštění komfortní zóny chtěl využít pro zlepšení svých již užívaných kreativních schopností v doménách designu a verbální tvorby. Do nového roku 2018 ale plánuji také začít se věnovat oboru, ve kterém mám znalosti a praktické zkušenosti omezené. Za takový obor jsem zvolil hudbu a hudební teorii, neboť je to právě hudba, která vedle literatury je jediným kreativním žánrem, který ve mně dokáže vyvolat nejhlubší emocionální zážitky. Proto věřím, že vzdělanější poslech a snad i produkce hudby mi umožní lépe reflektovat nad tím, proč specifičtí interpreti a skladatelé mají na mě daný vliv.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co se akademického pohledu na kreativitu týče, mám v plánu pokračovat ve výzkumu psychologie kreativity s konkrétním zaměřením na verbální, figurální a hudební kreativitu. Zajímá mě, zdali je talent pro zvolená média tvořivosti manifestován různě na kognitivní a neurofyzické úrovni člověka, nebo jsou deriváty nějakého univerzálního kreativního talentu, podobně jak vidíme v kognitivních teoriích inteligence, jejichž výzkum zná statisticko-teoretický konstrukt jménem </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">g</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (general intelligence). Neméně atraktivní otázkou pro mě je, zdali je možné identifikovat, v čem se liší eminentní kreativní tvůrci od méně úspěšných, a nakonec zdali je možné pozorovat genderové rozdíly v kreativitě, na které jsem již napsal krátký akademicky orientovaný článek.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I když nemusíme být fanoušci Pinkovy teze o tom, že v současném světě patří kreativita, empatie a systémové myšlení k nejdůležitějším dovednostem, které člověku zajistí, že se v post-industriálním světě založeném na ekonomice outsourcingu, automatizace a nadbytku uchytí, přesto kreativita patří k dovednostem, kterými se člověk podobně jako schopností jazyka liší od zbytku přírody. I proto je kreativita na plně lidské úrovni stále zatím nedosažitelným cílem ve vývoji umělé inteligence, čímž zatím našemu druhu stále zůstává unikát ryze lidský. Bez ohledu na talent nebo počet děl, rozvíjet kreativitu znamená rozvíjet lidskost, čemuž by se nikdy neměl záměrně vyhýbat. Jak ukázal můj krátký úvodní sestřih mého života, aniž bych se považoval za kreativního člověka, externí motivace být kreativním a kontinuální a vědomé pokoušení se dostat z komfortní zóny mi nakonec dodaly dostatek sebevědomí k tomu, abych se začal soukromě i profesně věnovat činnostem, které jsem předtím považoval za oblast mně nepřístupnou. Zároveň jsem ale zjistil, že rozvoj kreativity je nikdy nekončící proces, protože čím více si člověk důvěřuje, tím více chce tvořit a zlepšovat se, což znamená více učení a opětovné překonávání sebe sama.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><b>Zdroje</b></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BLOOM, Harold. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Úzkost z ovlivnění: teorie poezie</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Kontroverznějším tématem v současném psychologickém výzkumu jsou pouze genderové rozdíly v inteligenci. Cílem tohoto textu je zodpovědět otázku, zdali existuje výzkum, který použitím vhodných testovacích metod a statistického vyhodnocení může určité genderové rozdíly pozorovat. Pokud rozdíly ustanovíme, přichází na řadu složitější otázka určení, zdali tyto rozdíly jsou způsobené socio-kulturními nebo biologickými vlivy, případně jejich vzájemnou interakcí. Text chce motivovat zájem o danou problematiku a zároveň poukázat na možnosti, jak genderové rozdíly studovat. Text zakončuji spekulativní částí, která naznačuje, jaké konsekvence případné rozdíly v kreativitě genderů mohou mít.</p>\n<h2>Proč zkoumat genderové rozdíly v kreativitě?</h2>\n<p>V současné době žijeme ve společnosti, která je mnohými teoretiky a sociology pojmenována jako informační, postindustriální, síťová nebo kognitivní (např. Castells, Bell, Imbesi) a vyznačuje se důrazem na zpracování, analýzu a produkci informací, tedy imateriální komodity, jež není vázána místem ani časem, a je možné ji rychle transformovat a zasílat na jakékoli místo připojené do globální sítě internetu. Teoretik a praktikující architekt Lorenzo Imbesi si všímá role designu (a nepřímo také kreativity) a argumentuje, že přestože informace je dnes důležitou komoditou, mnohem důležitější pro je generování nových nápadů, a tím i informací, jež přináší firmám v konkurenčním boji výhodu, protože je to právě design a kreativita, kterými se firmy odlišují a komunikují k veřejnosti přidanou hodnotu svého produktu. Kreativita poskytuje diferenciální výhodu firmám, ale i jednotlivcům, neboť tato dovednost je v současné ekonomice informační či kognitivní společnosti ceněna. Lidé, kteří dokáží svou kreativitu využít i na pracovním trhu mají tedy objektivní výhodu oproti těm, jež toto nedokáží. Proto potenciální rozdíly v kreativitě mezi gendery by měly nejen ekonomické, ale i sociální dopady na společnost.</p>\n<p>Z hlediska vzdělávání jsou genderové rozdíly taktéž důležité, protože odlišnosti by měly být zaneseny do teorií i pedagogické praxe tak, aby každé dítě dokázalo dosáhnout svého maximálního potenciálu, což půjde tehdy, když budeme mít co nejpřesnější informace o specifikách jeho dovedností a kognitivních strategiích a stylech, kdy kognitivním stylem myslíme způsob, jakým jednotlivec zpracovává informace (Sternberg a Grigorenko, 2001). Gender dítěte, při prokázání genderových rozdílů v kreativitě, je důležitou proměnnou, které je třeba brát v potaz při aplikaci pedagogicko-psychologických teorií při vzdělávání.</p>\n<p>V neposlední řadě je důvodem, proč studovat genderové rozdíly v kreativitě, znatelná historická absence žen v oborech vyžadující kreativní a intelektuální dovednosti, jak si všiml jeden z předních světových odborníků na kreativitu Dean K. Simonton ve své publikaci <em>Greatness: who makes history and why</em> (Simonton, 1994). Je nedostatek žen v eminentních uměleckých a vědeckých oborech následkem socio-kulturních vlivů v podobě historické diskriminace a nedostatku přístupu ke vzdělávání, které přetrvávaly až do dvacátého století a v mnoha ohledech přetrvávají dodnes (Abraham, 2014; Baer a Kaufman, 2008), nebo může výzkum kreativity ukázat, že příčiny nejsou pouze socio-kulturního charakteru, ale svou roli hrají i odlišnosti na biologické úrovni?</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<h2>Pracovní definice kreativity</h2>\n<p>Předtím, než budu popisovat současný výzkum v kreativitě, je vhodné definovat, s jakým konceptem nebo definicí kreativity tento text pracuje. Vycházím z rozšířené a hojně citované definice v literatuře, která pojmenovává kreativitu jako produkci výsledků činnosti či nápadů, které jsou nové, překvapivé a užitečné (např. Hennessey a Amabile, 2010; Boden, 2004, s. 1). Zároveň jsem si v tomto textu vědom, že situace kolem definice kreativity je mnohavrstvá a existují komplexní modely kreativity, kterými odborníci se snaží zachytit kreativitu jako něco, co neexistuje pouze v hlavách jednotlivců jako kognitivní dovednost, ale je zároveň definována kontextuálně ve vztahu ke společnosti a kultuře, jak osvětlují komponentní modely kreativity od Amabile (Amabile, 1983) nebo socio-kulturní model (Sawyer, 2012, s. 123) argumentující, že výsledek činnosti je kreativní tehdy, pokud je společnost či odborníci daného oboru shledají kreativními. Podobné kontextuální uvažování najdeme i v předmětu lidského bádání, které historicky bylo spjato, často k nerozeznání, s kreativitou: v umění. Teoretici umění jako například Arthur Danto a po něm George Dickie přišli s teorií institucionálního umění, podle které objekt se sám od sebe nemůže stát uměleckým artefaktem. Teprve tehdy, když je tento objekt integrován do kontextu umění, dle Danta “Světa umění” (Artworld) (Danto, 1964), skládajícího se s teoretiků, kurátorů, uměleckých teorií, intepretací, muzeí, objektů a umělců, může se objekt stát uměním. Tato vlivná teorie mimo jiné vysvětluje, proč krabice Brillo nebo pisoár nejsou ve svém běžném prostředím uměním, ale stejné objekty užité Warholem nebo Marcelem Duchampem již ano. Danto píše, že co každodenní objekty v rukou těchto umělců dělá uměleckými artefakty je určitá teorie, která je dokáže zasadit do Světa umění. Bez [umělecké] teorie není pravděpodobné, že bychom je viděli jako umění, abychom je tak viděli, musí být součástí uměleckého světa (Danto, 1964, s. 581). Tato paralela mezi sociokulturním modelem kreativity a institucionální teorií umění mi přijde tak zřejmá, že jistě byla jinými autory rozpracována, avšak zatím jsem jejich provázanost v literatuře nepostřehl.</p>\n<h2>Jak zkoumat genderové rozdíly v kreativitě?</h2>\n<p>V současné době jsou hlavním nástrojem testování kreativity psychometrické testy divergentního myšlení spočívající v tom, že testují schopnost jednotlivce generovat co největší počet alternativní užití zadaných předmětů. Tento test dominuje současnému výzkumu, což s sebou může přinášet několik metodických problémů. v první řadě se jedná o test, který se zaměřuje na hodnocení fluence, tedy kvantity, a ne kvality možností, které jedinec vymyslel. Dále jsou tyto testy orientovány na verbální dovednosti, čímž mohou znevýhodňovat další, například vizuálně-prostorové (figurální) domény kreativity, a tím i jeden z genderů, zvláště na pozadí výzkumu, který prozrazuje, že dívky a ženy převyšují své protějšky v jazykových dovednostech, perceptuální rychlosti a verbální fluenci (Artola, 2010).</p>\n<p>Na figurální doménu kreativity se orientuje další typ testů, jehož zadání spočívá v produkci originální kresby a většinou se používá pro testování dětí a středoškolských studentů. Test z kvalitativního pohledu hodnotí počet objektů (fluenci), flexibilitu, originalitu a elaboraci detailů (Artola, 2010).</p>\n<p>Vedle psychometrických testů je možné zkoumat kreativitu pomocí funkční magnetické rezonance na úrovni jednotlivých mozkových struktur, kde především tvar a aktivita dané části mozku korelující s činností jednotlivce jsou empirická data, kterými lze provádět komparace mezi jednotlivci.</p>\n<p>Další možností, jak zkoumat kreativitu, je historický pohled na jedince, kteří počtem a kvalitou své tvorby si vysloužili podle odborníků v doméně jejich působnosti, ale i širší veřejnosti, eminentní postavení. Tento pohled ukazuje nejzřetelněji, že genderové rozdíly v kreativní a kognitiní eminenci existují. i když historický pohled poskytuje nejméně informací k vysvětlení rozdílů z kognitivního hlediska, je nesmírně užitečný pro studium toho, jak širší kontext ovlivňuje či v případě žen limituje kreativní tvorbu, zvláště při větším důrazu v současném výzkumu kreativity na komponentní (Amabile, 1983) a socio-kulturní modely (Sawyer, 2012, s. 123) kreativity.</p>\n<h2>Výzkumu genderových rozdílů v kreativitě</h2>\n<h3>Psychometrické testy</h3>\n<p>V roce 1974 Kogan (Kogan, 1974) první zásadní výzkum genderových rozdílů v kreativitě a již v té době, tedy přibližně před 34 lety, poznamenal, že pokud by nějaký výzkum prokázal, že jeden z genderů je více kreativní než druhý, snesla by se na něj značná vlna kritiky. Kogan ve vlastním výzkumu však zjistil, že mezi gendery panuje relativní rovnost. Baer a Kaufman (Baer a Kaufman, 2008) revidovali Koganovo zjištění a potvrzují, že v literatuře se sice od té doby objevily důkazy o tom, že v určitých oblastech má jeden gender navrch, stále můžeme mluvit o relativní rovnosti v kreativních schopnostech.</p>\n<p>Baer a Kaufman recenzují aktuální články věnující se tématu a ve svém shrnutí zmiňují, že většina studií nenachází mezi chlapci a dívkami žádné rozdíly, přestože zmiňují, že existují výzkumy, ve kterých skóruje jeden gender lépe, a podobný počet výzkumů argumentuje přesně opačně. (Baer a Kaufman, 2008) Kde naopak nachází rozdíl ve prospěch mužů je to, co označují za kreativní produktivitu, tedy absolutní počet kreativních děl vypracovaných muži. He a Wong (He, 2011) dále zkoumají literaturu a dochází k tomu, že statisticky nesignifikatní rozdíly byly reportovány v testech kreativní osobnosti, produktu kreativní tvorby a kreativního procesu. Potvrzují také, že některé výzkumy našly signifikantní rozdíly ve prospěch mužů a některé ve prospěch žen.</p>\n<p>Artola et al. (Artola, 2010) shrnuje výzkum genderových rozdílů v kreativitě a komentuje analýzu více než 80 studií, které zkoumaly genderové rozdíly v testech divergentního myšlení, indikující, že více než polovina výzkumu neprokazuje genderové rozdíly, dvě třetiny zbývajícího výzkumu ukazuje na lepší výsledky dívek nebo žen, a jedna třetina výzkumu pak přisuzuje lepší výsledky chlapcům nebo mužům.</p>\n<p>Vzhledem ke komplexitě a nestabilnosti definice kreativity, která zahrnuje hned několik paradigmat, jak kreativitu pojímat, Abraham upozorňuje na spekulativnost přístupu, který se snaží redukovat celý koncept kreativity na jednu proměnnou genderu (Abraham, 2014). v meta analýze z roku 2016 Abraham (Abraham, 2016) dále poukazuje na to, že v její recenzi dosavadní literatury je velmi málo výzkumu, který by jednoznačně prokázal zakořeněnou představu, že ženy jsou více kreativní ve verbální a umělecké doméně, kdežto muži pak v kreativitě mechanickým a vědeckých oborů. Na tento bod budu výzkumem navazovat v sekci textu, ve které se objevují data, jež ukazují, že při analýze výsledků nikoli z pohledu střední hodnoty, ale variability výsledků je možné identifikovat jednoznačné rozdíly v mechanickém uvažování a matematických dovednostech, a to především v horních percentilech distribuce výsledků, kde jsou muži zastoupení více než ženy.</p>\n<p>Při zaměření se na předškolní a dospívající děti výzkum ukazuje, že v této věkové kategorii se některé genderové rozdíly mohou vyskytnout. Artola et al. (Artola, 2010) testovali s dětmi jejich verbální a figurální (grafickou) kreativitu, kde dívky skórovaly statisticky signifikatně lépe jak ve verbální kreativitě, tak i v celkovém skóre tzv. globální kreativitu zahrnující oba typy kreativity. Lepší skóre dívek bylo vidět především na <em>průměru distribuce výsledků</em>, který byl vyšší než u chlapců. Artola et al. citují další výzkumy podporující jejich vlastní empirické výsledky, které indikují, v rozporu s Abraham, 2016, že<strong> ženy skórují lépe než muži na testech jazykových dovedností, rychlosti perceptuálního zpracování a verbální fluence</strong>.</p>\n<p>Co se týče figurální kreativity, v té se vedlo chlapcům lépe pouze na úrovní základní školy, především v jejich schopnosti elaborace výkresu a užití originálních elementů. u středoškoláků Artela et al. stále nachází rozdíly ve prospěch dívek na verbálních testech, kdežto u chlapců se předchozí figurální výhoda již neprojevuje. Zdá se, že jakékoli rozdíly a výhody mezi dívkami a chlapci v předpubertálním věku a v začátku puberty jsou, postupem času se tyto rozdíly vyrovnávají a v období puberty se začínají převracet ve prospěch chlapců (Abraham, 2016).  Někteří výzkumníci upozorňují, že příčinou by mohl být fakt, že určité oblasti a struktury mozku zapojené do zpracování jazyka, prostorové paměti a vývoje sociálních schopností mají u genderů jinou rychlost a pořadí vývoje (Hanlon, 1999; Sax, 2005, 2007). Lynn (Lynn, 1999) argumentuje pomocí vlastní tzv. Vývojové teorie, že rychlejší dospívání dívek má za následek jejich vyšší průměrné IQ kolem 13 roku, ale již kolem 15 roku rychlost dospívání dívek zpomaluje, kdežto u chlapců stále pokračuje, což dle Lynna způsobuje nejen dohnání deficitu IQ, ale také po 16 roce dokonce vyšší průměrné IQ skóre až o 4 body. Lynnova teorie je kontroverzní a jak sám v článku píše, má hned několik kritiků, přesto splňuje elementární kritéria pro vědeckou práci, a tak i v genderových rozdílech kreativity je možné jeho teorii brát jako jednu z hypotéz vysvětlující případné rozdíly, i proto, že kreativita pozitivně koreluje s IQ o hodnotě 120 a vyšší (Jauk, 2013; Franková, 2011, s. 19).</p>\n<h3>Výzkum rozdílů ve figurální tvorbě</h3>\n<p>Zatímco rozdíly v hodnocení figurální kreativity vykazují podobné výsledky, podíváme-li se konkrétněji na obsah kreseb, které děti vytváří, zjistíme znatelné rozdíly. Abraham cituje výzkum japonských badatelů, kteří se zabývali tím, jak se liší dětské kresby, pokud se jim nechá volný prostor kreslit, co budou chtít. Iijima a kolegové (Iijima, 2001) reportují, že nachází genderové rozdíly v motivech, barvách, kompozicích objektů a výrazů v kresbách dětí: “Chlapci mají tendenci kreslit mobilní a mechanické objekty tmavými a chladnými barvami a často užívají kompozice z ptačí perspektivy, zatímco dívky rády kreslí motivy lidí (především dívky a ženy), květiny a motýly světlými a teplými barvami a tendují k tomu, že uspořádávají motivy [na obrázku] do řady na zemi” (Iijima, 2001). Iijima et al. vysvětlují, že kromě objektů a barev se chlapci od dívek liší ve svých kresbách tím, že kladou v kompozici větší důraz na třídimenzionální zobrazení vztahů mezi objekty. Tento typ kompozice se objevuje u chlapců ve 24, 4 % případů, kdežto u dívak je velmi vzácně v 1, 9 % případů. Naopak dvoudimenzionální kompozice v řadě se vyskytuje u dívek v 74, 4 %, zatímco u chlapů v 20, 4 %. Chlapci navíc mají tendenci v kompozici zdůrazňovat hlavní prvky obrázku; dívky kreslí jednotlivé objekty na scéně přibližně stejně (Iijima, 2001). Tyto rozdíly neříkají nic o tom, zda pocházejí ze socio-kulturních vlivů nebo za nimi stojí i biologické faktory. v případě výzkumu Iijima a kolegů je třeba brát v potaz, že výzkum probíhal v Japonsku, tedy silně konzervativní zemi, kde genderové role jsou stále jasně oddělené.</p>\n<p>Iijima a kolegové nejen proto do výzkumu zahrnuli i dívky, kterým byla diagnostikována kongenitální adrenální hyperplazie (KAH), což je genetická porucha, jež se vyskytuje už prenatálně a projevuje se nadprodukcí adrenálního androgenu. Dívky s touto poruchou vykazují fyzickou i behaviorální maskulinizaci (Hall, 2004; Kongenitální adrenální hyperplázie) a maskulinní vzory při hře, kdy si hrají s objekty preferovanými chlapci (Hines, 2000). v literatuře se objevuje výzkum, který reportuje, že dívky s KAH mají menší amygdaly než kontrolní skupina žen a při úkonu, kdy mají sledovat lidský obličej, aktivují amygdalu více než kontrolní skupina žen, ale ne více než kontrolní skupina mužů (citováno v Abraham, 2014).</p>\n<p>Analýza nakreslených obrázků od dívek s KAH ukazuje, že jejich výtvory vykazují silně maskulinní prvky, znatelně více než u dívek bez této diagnózy a zároveň výtvory se mnoho nelišily od kreseb zdravých chlapců (Iijima, 2001). Tyto výsledky poukazují na skutečnost, že přestože ve výzkumu kreativity není patrno příliš rozdílů mezi gendery, podíváme-li se na způsoby či strategie, kterými gendery dochází ke kreativním výsledkům, zřetelné rozdíly již nacházíme. Abraham (Abraham, 2014) navrhuje, že <strong>tyto rozdíly v kreativních strategiích</strong>, které lze vidět ve výzkumu s dívkami diagnostikovanými s KAH poukazují na možné biologické rozdíly v tom, jak jednotlivé gendery se liší v řešení kreativních činností za použití různých strategií a tyto strategie, jak tvrdí Abraham, bychom mohli zkoumat v mozkové činnosti, kde bychom mohli objevit korelace mezi odlišnými kognitivními strategiemi řešení kreativních úkolů a manifestací těchto rozdílů v různých částech mozku.</p>\n<h3>Výzkum z pozice neurovědy</h3>\n<p>Neurovědecký výzkum genderových rozdílů v kreativitě zkoumá pravdivost teze, že existují funkční nebo strukturální rozdíly mezi gendery, které se projevují při kreativních úkonech. Strukturální rozdíly byly skutečně potvrzené v kortikální tlouštce přední části spánkového laloku a orbitofrontální oblasti u mužů a větší kortikální konvoluce a komplexity v neokortexu u žen (Luders a Toga, 2010). Genderové rozdíly dále byly zpozorovány ve zpracování emocí, kde u žen jako reakce na negativní emoce byla nalezena zvýšená aktivita v levé části amygdaly, ale u mužů stejná část byla aktivnější při pozitivních emocích (Stevens a Hamann, 2012).</p>\n<p>Abraham (Abraham, 2016) cituje meta analýzu genderových rozdílů ve struktuře mozku, kde 167 studií vyhovovalo kritériím meta analýzy, která poukázala na to, že v literatuře výzkum u mužů prokázal větší objem šedé hmoty mozkové v několika regionech, například amygdaly, hipokampu, zadního kórového centra (posterior gyrus cingulis), putamenu (část striata), spánkového pólu (ve spánkovém laloku) a mozečku (cerebella). Naproti tomu ženy mají více šedé hmoty v regionech předního laloku, předního gyru, středního předního gyru, parietálního operkula, thalamu, laterální ocipitálního kortexu, insulárního kortex či Heschlova gyra. Rozdíly se vyskytují nejen v objemu, ale také v hustotě hmoty v daných oblastech.</p>\n<p>Velmi popularizovaným výzkumem, který také poukazuje na existenci strukturálních genderových rozdílů, je výzkum lidského strukturálního konektomu mozku modelující rozdíly v propojenosti jednotlivých hemisfér. Zatímco u mužů ukázal větší propojenost v rámci hemisfér (tzv. intrahemisferickou propojenost), u žen naopak zjistil větší propojenost napříč hemisférami (tzv. interhemisferickou propojenost) (Ingalhalikar, 2014). Abraham (Abraham, 2016) dodává, že tento výzkum byl příklad kontroverznosti, kterou je studium genderových rozdílů na úrovni neurověd obestřen, neboť zatímco někteří jej hodnotili jako zcela průlomový, jiní badatelé jej zásadně zpochybňovali, když například poukazovali na to, že výzkum nesprávně prezentoval rozdíly v propojenosti mezi a uvnitř hemisfér jako kvalitativní rozdíl, přestože se spíše jednalo o rozdíly kvantitativní, čehož si dle Joel (Joel, 2014) může čtenář těžko povšimnout. S Abraham zde ale nesouhlasím v tom, že kritika Joel představuje binární opozici k postoji autorů výzkumu. Joel totiž ve svém kritickém dopise <strong>přiznává, že autoři našli rozdíly v síle propojení některých spojení</strong>, ale kritizuje fakt, že tyto rozdíly nejsou tak fundamentální, tedy kvalitativní, jak je autoři prezentují, <strong>ale pouze kvantitativní</strong> (Joel, 2014).</p>\n<p>Jelikož citovaná literatura poukazuje na existenci strukturálních mozkových rozdílů, dává smysl zkoumat, zda se tyto rozdíly projevují i při kreativních úkonech. Pomocí funkční magnetické rezonance Abraham (Abraham, 2014) a její kolegové zjistili, že zatímco ve výsledcích testů kreativity nejsou rozdíly, což implikuje behaviorální podobnost genderů, na magnetické rezonanci vyšlo najevo, že gendery pro stejný kreativní výkon užívají jiných struktur mozku. i když oba gendery využívaly hojně levé mozkové hemisféry, muži měli více aktivované části jako inferiorní frontální gyrus, orbitofrontální kortex a inferiorní parietální lalok, a naopak u žen se více aktivovaly části jako anteriorní a posteriorní superiorní temporální gyrus a superiorní parietální lalok. Ještě větší rozdíly se našly v testu generování nových použití pro známé každodenní objekty se u mužů aktivovaly mozkové sítě asociované s operacemi sémantické paměti, učení na základě předdefinovaných pravidel a rozhodování na základě výsledku (outcome-based decision making). u žen v tom samém testu byly především aktivované superiorní temporální regiony, které jsou asociované s produkcí mluveného jazyka a jazykovému porozumění (Price, 2010). Dále ženy ve srovnání s muži užívaly více anteriorních superiorních temporálních regionů, které jsou zahrnuty ve zpracování řeči, a posteriorních superiorních temporálních regionů, které se <strong>vztahují k teorii mysli, sociální percepci obličejů či rozpoznání biologického pohybu a audio-vizuálnímu porozumění</strong> (citováno v Abraham, 2014). Ve stručnosti se zdá, že muži užívají mozkové struktury zahrnuté v sémantické kognici, učení podle pravidel a rozhodování, kdežto ženy aktivovaly regiony mozku vztahované ke zpracování řeči, sociální percepci a teorii mysli.</p>\n<p>Podobné dělení následuje i teorie empatizování-systematizování (E-S) Simona Baron-Cohena, který tuto teorii vytvořil v kontextu studia autistických subjektů. E-S teorie představuje myšlenku dvou pomyslných protipólů, kognitivních strategií. Na jedné straně je styl systematizující nebo analytický, který vyniká v analýze a tvorbě systémů, a na straně druhé je styl empatizující, který vyniká ve schopnosti číst a predikovat lidské jednání. Baron-Cohen hovoří o autismu jako hypermaskulinizaci mozku (Baron-Cohen, 2005), kde repetitivní, systematické chování a potíže s teorií mysli, jež je nutnou podmínkou pro schopnost číst lidské jednání, a tak “empatizovat”, jsou dva extrémy na spektru E-S, které se v kombinaci vysoké S a nízké E potkávají v autistických subjektech. Baron-Cohen považuje systematizující mozek za psychometricky mužský a empatizující za psychometricky ženský (Baron-Cohen, 2002), což je podpořeno dalším výzkumem Baron-Cohena a dalších, ve kterých se ukazuje, že ženy se průměrně více zajímají o lidi, kdežto muže jeví větší zájem o neživé objekty (Baron-Cohen, 2012).</p>\n<p>Baron-Cohen neargumentuje, že pouze muži mají “mužské mozky”, ale tvrdí, že mozek typu S je u mužů častějí a mozek typu E zase najdeme častěji u žen. Baron-Cohen v dřívějším výzkumu rozlišuje pohlaví od genderu, kde pohlaví považuje za biologicky dané, kdežto gender uznává jako socio-kulturní konstrukt, avšak v nejnovější práci (Lai, 2017) se již objevuje v práci jeho i kolegů pojem “sex/gender”, který vyjadřuje nemožnost zcela tyto dva pojmy od sebe odlišit, což se projevuje i v jedné z hlavních tezí jeho E-S teorie, která říká, že spíše než sekundární pohlavní znaky rozhoduje o typicky mužském nebo typicky ženském chování a kognitivních vzorcích vliv prenatálního testosteronu, který ve zvýšeném množství může u obou pohlaví vést k (hyper)maskulinizaci mozku, a tím i kognitivních vzorců/stylů (Baron-Cohen, 2002).</p>\n<p>Baron-Cohen cituje několik empirických studií, které komentují vliv prenatálního testosteronu na chování a zájmy dětí. Kolem prvního roku života se projevují sexuální dimorfismus v preferencích, na co děti fixují svou pozornost. Chlapci při sledování filmových vzorků preferují pohybující se automobil, kdežto dívky film ukazující lidský obličej, což následuje E-S teorii predikujcí u chlapců větší zájem o pohybující se neživé objekty (mechanické systémy) a u dívek zájem o lidské subjekty a jejich obličeje (Baron-Cohen, 2012). Dívky dále narozdíl od chlapců ukazují kolem prvního roku větší oční kontakt, kdy délka očního kontaktu je inverzní funkcí úrovní prenatálního testosteronu, tedy čím více prenatálního testosteronu, tím méně dítě vyhledává oční kontakt (citováno v Baron-Cohen, 2012). Tyto rozdíly Baron-Cohen replikoval v hojně citovaném výzkumu i na novorozencích den po jejich narození (Connellan, 2000), kde autoři argumentují, že den po narození není možné očekávat, že by novorozence znatelně mohli ovlivnit socio-kulturní vlivy, a tudíž argumentují, že tyto rozdíly jsou konzistentní s biologickými příčinami, nejspíše neurogenetického a/nebo neuroendokrinního charakteru.</p>\n<p>Zároveň je zde možné zmínit již citovaný výzkum z Japonska, který analyzuje dětské kresby, jež obdobně následující vlastnosti predikované E-S teorií, a nový výzkum, poprvé publikovaný v roce 2016, který testuje preference preference na genderově stereotypické hračky a to tak, že zkoumá tři kohorty dětí podle věku: od 9 do 17 měsíců, 18 do 23 měsíců a 24 do 32 měsíců. Genderově stereotypické preference hraček byly nalezeny ve všech těchto skupinách. S narůstajícím věkem stereotypické preference rostly (Todd, 2017).</p>\n<p>Pokud ženy mají podle Baron-Cohena statisticky větší pravděpodobnost, že jejich kognitivní vzorce a kognitivní styl bude vycházet a benefitovat z empatizování, kdežto muži ze systematizujícího kognitivního stylu, projeví se to i v genderových rozdílech v kreativitě? Lin et al. (Lin, 2012) ve svém výzkumu hledali vztah mezi kreativitou a osobnostními charakteristikami a našli signifikatní pozitivní korelaci mezi otevřeností k novým zkušenostem (Openness) a skóre na testu divergentního myšlení, kdežto emocionalita negativně korelovala s kreativním řešením problémů (insight problem solving). Lin et al. reportují, že ženám se dařilo lépe na testech divergentního myšlení a muži skórovali lépe na testech kreativního řešení problémů. Kreativní řešení problémů se liší od testu divergentního myšlení tím, že přestože i zde je kreativita nutností pro vyřešení otevřené otázky, vyžaduje konkrétní řešení, čímž tato kreativní činnost nabývá uzavřené charakteristiky a mnohem více se podobá vědeckému procesu hledání řešení, zatímco divergentní úkony mohou být spíše přirovnány k uměleckém procesům s otevřeným koncem (Lin a Lien, 2013). Rozdíl mezi divergentním myšlení a kreativním řešení problémů se dále projevuje tak, že dle empirické evidence tyto dva úkony mezi sebou nekorelují a kreativní řešení problémů predikuje lépe inteligence, kapacita pracovní paměti a genderové rozdíly v osobnostních vlastnostech (Lin, 2012), kdežto tyto kognitivní faktory již nekorelují s divergentním myšlením. z tohoto důvodů Lin et al. (Lin, 2012) navrhují, že by toto překvapivé zjištění mohla vysvětlit <em>teorie dvou procesů kognice </em>(dual-process theories of cognition). Ta postuluje, že lidé užívají dvou alternativních systémů kognitivních procesů: Systém 1 a Systém 2. Systém 1 je heuristický systém, který zpracovává informace v asociačním módu, intuitivně, bez vynaložení velkého úsilí. Je to systém, který se evolučně vyvinul dříve a zahrnuje předchozí znalosti a zkušenosti. Na druhé straně Systém 2 (analytický systém) zahrnuje logické a na pravidlech založené procesy, které nejsou bez úsilí, ale využívají kognitivních zdrojů. Tento druhý systém je evolučně mladší a umožňuje abstraktní, sylogistické myšlení (Lin, 2012). Lin a Lien, 2013 navrhovali, že Systém 1 je vhodný kognitivní styl pro divergentní myšlení, zatímco kombinace Systému 1 a Systému 2 je nutná pro kreativní řešení problémů, protože kromě generování možných řešení je třeba i analytický soud toho, jaké řešení je v daném kontextu problému nejvhodnější. Jejich výzkum prokázal, že tento vztah a zároveň hypotéza teorie dvou procesů kognice platí, když u žen našli statisticky signifikatní lepší skóre na většině parametrech divergentních testů, včetně osobností charakteristiky otevřenosti novým zkušenostem a emocionality, které odpovídají kognitivnímu stylu Systém 1, kdežto u mužů našli lepší výsledky na většině parametrech kreativního řešení problémů a jsou statisticky signifikatně méně otevřeni novým zkušenostem a méně emocionální (Lin, 2012). Stručně řečeno, dle výzkumu Lin, 2012 divergentní myšlení pozitivně koreluje s inteligencí, výrazně pozitivně koreluje s otevřenosti novým zkušenostem, emocionalitou, extraverzí, což jsou vlastnosti, které korelují s genderem žen a také kognitivním stylem Systém 1. Na druhou stranu kreativní řešení problémů koreluje negativně s emocionalitou a výrazně pozitivně s inteligencí, což jsou vlastnosti, které dále korelují s genderem mužů a také kognitivním Systémem 2. Nutno podotknout, že Lin, 2012 nachází, že osobnostní charakteristiky, především otevřenost novým zkušenostem, snižuje prediktivní sílu genderu v úkonech kreativní fluence a flexibility, kde genderové rozdíly ve fluenci byly zcela eliminovány, když výzkum v regresivní analýze bral v potaz otevřenost k novým zkušenostem jako samostatnou proměnnou (pro podrobné data regresivní analýzy viz Lin, 2012).</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<h3>Kritika výzkumu genderových rozdílů v kreativitě</h3>\n<p>Přestože psychometrické výzkumy kreativity neprokazují jednoznačnou převahu jednoho genderu nad druhým a spíše se uchyluje k hodnocení, že v nejpoužívanějších testech kreativity, tedy v testech divergentního myšlení a a alternativního užití každodenních objektů jsou si gendery v kreativitě rovni, ve výše uvedeném stručném přehledu identifikuji několik vzorců, které by mohli přeci jen odkrýt určité rozdíly. v první řadě vychází najevo, že do věku přibližně 16 let dívky skórují stejně nebo lépe než chlapci a zároveň se kvalitativně liší ve výsledcích figurálních testů kreativity, kde dívky preferují dvoudimenzionální, barevnou kompozici znázorňující lidské, především ženské postavy, kdežto chlapci v kresbě signifikantně více vykazují trojdimenzionální kompozici obsahující pohyblivé objekty spíše než lidské postavy. Co je pro mě zajímavé je fakt, že tyto zdánlivě genderové rozdíly prakticky vymizí, pokud bereme v potaz genetickou poruchu kongenitální adrenální hyperplazie (KAH), jež na hormonální úrovni dívky mění tak, že vykazují vzorce kresby a zájmů, jež se stereotypicky, minimálně v naší západní společnosti vztahují k maskulinním vzorcům chování a zájmům, a to i přesto, že tyto dívky podstoupily operaci pohlavních orgánů a byly vychovávány tak, že by na ně měly působit stejné socio-kulturní vlivy jako pro dívky v kontrolní skupině. Že se genderové rozdíly začínají projevovat ve prospěch chlapců s nástupem puberty by mohlo odpovídat výzkumu Barona-Cohena, který dlouhodobě prosazuje teorii, že prenatální množství testosteronu, bez ohledu na gender, ovlivňuje, zdali daná osoba bude vykazovat chování, zájmy a dovednosti odpovídající stereotypizované (hyper)maskulinizaci.</p>\n<p>Subjekty na autistickém spektru, ženy i muže, kterými se Baron-Cohen zabývá, lze podle něho považovat za extrémní případ maskulinního mozku, což se projevuje v nadprůměrném systematizování a podprůměrném empatizování, jak tyto dovednosti definuje jeho E-S teorie. Citovaný výzkum podporující aspekty E-S teorie, jako například sexuální/genderový dismorfismus u dětí v preferenci hraček nebo očním kontaktu, není bez kritiky. Zásadní knihu <em>Delusions of gender: how our minds, society, and neurosexism create difference</em> analyzující obecné problémy výzkumu genderových rozdílů nejen v kreativitě napsala akademická psycholožka Cordelia Fine (Fine, 2011). Barres (Barres, 2010) v recenzi této knihy, ze které níže čerpám, například píše, že se Fine zaměřuje na výzkumný design již zmiňovaného a hojně citovaného výzkumu novorozenců a jejich preferencí pozorování obličeje versus pohybujícího se objektu, na kterém Baron-Cohen zakládá svou argumentaci. Fine tvrdí, že výzkumný design nevylučuje možnost, že v experimentu mohl výzkumník dát novorozenci nevědomě pokyny, aby se věnoval jednomu konkrétními objektu. Dále Cline píše, že i když bychom našli u novorozenců tyto rozdíly, není jasné, jak jsou relevantní pro chování v dospělosti. v neposlední řadě Cline upozorňuje na metodologické nedostatky výzkumu v podobě malého počtu testovacích subjektů, zveličování nepodstatných rozdílů, které podle Cline mohou být kompenzovány vhodně zvolenou intervencí v podobě cvičení a trénování dané činnosti.</p>\n<p>Cine se přidala k Joel svým kritickým komentářem k již opět zmíněnému výzkumu lidského konektomu <em>Sex differences in the structural connectome of the human brain</em> (Ingalhalikar, 2014), který prokazoval u mužů větší propojení uvnitř hemisféry a u žen mezi hemisférami. <strong>Cine tento výzkum považuje za “neurosexistický”</strong> (Cine, 2013), protože podle jejího názoru autoři tohoto výzkumu překročili to, co ukazují data, když ve svém článku spekulativně navrhli, že: “mužské mozky jsou strukturovány, aby umožnily propojení mezi percepcí a koordinovanou akcí, kdežto ženské mozky jsou navrženy tak, aby umožnily komunikaci mezi analytickým a intuitivním módem zpracování”. (Ingalhalikar, 2014) Ingalhalikar et al. zde poskytují tímto nálezem rozdílů v propojenosti mozku mezi gendery strukturální argument pro výzkum Lin, 2012, který z behaviorálního hlediska popisuje dva módy kognitivního zpracování (relevantního pro kreativitu), konkrétně zmíněné módy Systém 1 (intuitivní a asociační) a Systém 2 (analytický, na pravidlech založený). Cine konkrétně komentovala výzkum konektomu jako “jemně neurosexistický”, protože “podporuje a legitimizuje genderové stereotypy způsobem, který není vědecky podložený” (Cine, 2013). Cine (Cine, 2013) cituje výzkum (Im, 2008), který argumentuje, že strukturální rozdíly v propojenosti mozku jsou důsledkem rozdílů tělesné velikosti (ženy jsou v průměru menší než muži, což vede v absolutních číslech k menšímu mozku, ale ke stejné velikosti, bereme-li v potaz velikost mozku relativně k tělesné velikosti), protože větší mozek neznamená jen zjednodušené zvětšení, ale nese si s sebou i nutné strukturální změny, které umožňují větší velikost. Navíc tento výzkum nebere podle Cine v potaz “genderově ovlivněné” (gendered) zážitky jako například koníčky, studované předměty ve škole a na univerzitě a participaci ve sportovních aktivitách.</p>\n<p>Již uvedený výzkum Barona-Cohena s novorozenci ale nabízí protiargument, když tvrdí, že preference vnímání obličeje versus objektu se liší již k prvnímu roku života, a výzkum z roku 2000 (Connellan, 2000) ukazuje rozdíly již od prvního dne, což je příliš brzo na to, aby se jakékoli socio-kulturní vlivy projevily. Tento výzkum, jak víme, Cine kritizuje pro nedostatky v metodologii. Na to ale reaguje Baron-Cohen jako jeden ze spoluatorů výzkumu, když v recenzi (Baron-Cohen, 2010) knihy <em>Delusions of Gender</em> poukazuje na zjevnou politickou dimenzi Cine, která v knize cituje mnohé (mužské) vědce z 18. a 19. století a snaží se je porovnávat se současnými vědci, kteří by snad v dnešní době taktéž usilovali o to upírat ženám základní lidská práva a připoutat je “ke plotnám”, jinak řečeno, Baron-Cohen naznačuje, že Cine ve své knize píše, jako kdyby se nic zásadního v sexismu ve vědě nezměnilo. Po tomto rétorickém úvodu se ale Baron-Cohen zaměřuje na již konkrétní argumenty Cine, které vidí jako problematické. Tak zaprvé nesouhlasí, že pouhou změnou sociopsychologických proměnných při testování kognitivních rozdílů dokážeme všechny rozdíly smazat. Baron-Cohen souhlasí, že očekávání a to, jak se člověk cítí při testu, jsou důležité parametry, ale píše, že: “to, že manipulace sociálních proměnných mění chování nedokazuje, že jsou to právě tyto proměnné, které zapřičiňují spontánní sexuální rozdíly v první řadě” (Baron-Cohen, 2010). Potom, co Baron-Cohen reaguje na metodologickou kritiku svého výzkumu, zmiňuje důležitý bod týkající se postoje Cine: zatímco Baron-Cohen a ostatní vědci jsou podle Barona-Cohena umírnění v tom, když tvrdí, že genderové rozdíly jsou nejspíše ovlivněné jak biologií, tak i sociálních (socio-kulturních) vlivů, tak pozice Cine je radiální v tom, že odmítá jakoukoli možnost, že biologie hraje nějakou roli v genderových rozdílech. Polemický charakter argumentace Cine a její mísení politiky a vědy podle Barona-Cohena ignoruje fakt, že člověk (vědec) může podporovat rovnost genderu a být proti jakékoli diskriminaci ve společnosti a zároveň se zajímat a zkoumat genderové rozdíly.</p>\n<p>Další kritiku výzkumu genderových rozdílů nalezneme ve článku pro žurnál <em>Frontiers in Neuroscience</em>, který publikovala Fine společně s Jordan-Young, Keiser a Rippon (Rippon et al., 2014). Poukazují na institucionální problémy výzkumu neurovědy genderových rozdílů citací výzkumu, který tvrdí, že pouze výzkumy, které potvrzují genderové rozdíly, jsou publikované, a navíc databáze s těmito rozdíly umožňují vyhledávaní pouze sexuálních/genderových rozdílů, nikoli podobností. Rippon et al. dále navrhují, aby neurovědci, pokud chtějí validně studovat genderové rozdíly, by se měli seznámit s výzkumem genderových studií, a především s pojmem intersekcionality, který v genderových studiích označuje princip toho, že “důležité sociální identity jak gender, etnicita a sociální třída se vzájemně konstituují, posilují a naturalizují”. (Rippon et al., 2014)</p>\n<p>Jak jsem již na začátku této sekce ukázal, studium genderových rozdílů v kreativitě je nekonzistentní a pouze na základě obtížnosti uchopení kreativity jako fenoménu se jedná o obtížný úkol, neboť nejen, že takový výzkum musí mít potřebné metodologické nástroje pro odlišení biologických a socio-kulturních vlivů, ale zároveň musí neustále bojovat s tím, jak se kreativita jako koncept redefinuje. Jinak řečeno, výzkum kreativity a genderových rozdílů není snadný, a jelikož se nejedná o ryze logickou úlohu, kdy jednoduše z axiomů dokážeme odvodit správné odpovědi, nemůžeme se spekulaci vyhnout. Zcela souhlasím s kritikou Cine a dalších, že výzkum genderových rozdílů v kreativitě a obecněji v kognici je velmi náchylný k rychlé a nezodpovědné popularizi v médiích, čímž se do společnosti diseminují pokřivené informace, jež mohou utvrzovat v nepravdivých a škodlivých stereotypech. Na druhou stranu není dle mého názoru možné jakýkoli výzkum, který prokáže genderové rozdíly, krizitovat z “neurosexismu”, stejně tak všechny výzkumy prokazující genderové rozdíly osočit z nedostatečné metodologie. Lidé jsou sociálními bytostmi a je nevyhnutelné, že interakce biologie a sociálních vlivů existuje, načež reagoval obor epigenetiky, který právě tuto interakci přiznává, jakou zásadní pro spouštění a vypínání určitých genů během života člověka jako reakce či přizpůsobení na prostředí, ve kterém se organismus nachází. Jak uvádí Baron-Cohen, extrémní sociální determinismus, tak jak jej prosazuje Cine a jiní, vede například k tomu, že vývojové neuronální poruchy jako autismus, problémy s učením a opožděný jazykový vývoj, který ovlivňuje více chlapce než dívky, stejně tak levorukost, jež se také vyskytuje častěji u chlapců, musíme vysvětlovat pouze z pozice sociálních a sexistických vlivů ve společnosti nebo sexismu v rodině (Baron-Cohen, 2010). Je možné, že dříve nebo později bude ukázáno, že příčiny, proč více chlapců, než dívek je levorukých jsou ryze socio-kulturní, ale výše citovaný výzkum o strukturách mozku, silných a slabých stránek jednotlivých genderů ve výzkumu kreativity a vztah autismu a genderu jsou zatím dostatečně přesvědčivé, abychom řekli, že biologie ovlivňuje více než 0 % rozdílů mezi gendery a nechť výzkum prokáže, o jak přesně vysoké číslo se jedná.</p>\n<h3>Výzkum historické eminence a mužská variabilita</h3>\n<p>Ať už uznáme, že existující genderové rozdíly v kreativitě na základě biologických, socio-kulturních faktorů, v reálném světě pozorujeme znatelný rozdíl v tom, jak se projevují jednotlivé gendery v eminentních kreativních úspěšíš a výkonech. Tuto historickou diskrepanci zmapoval například Dean K. Simonton, kapacita v oboru výzkumu psychologie kreativity (Simonton, 1994). Odpověď na otázku, zdali je nedostatek žen v eminentních uměleckých a vědeckých oborech následkem socio-kulturních vlivů v podobě zjevné historické diskriminace a nedostatku přístupu ke vzdělávání, které znatelně přetrvávaly až do dvacátého století a v mnoha ohledech přetrvávají dodnes (Abraham, 2014; Baer a Kaufman, 2008), nebo v tomto textu uvedených biologických, strukturálních či behaviorálních rozdílů, je složitá a vyžaduje interdisciplinární pohled na problém, který by zahrnoval jak výzkum psychologie a neurovědy kreativity, ale také sociologie a historie. Je zřejmé, že je to nad rámec tohoto textu. Přesto se pokusím shrnout výzkum, který by mohl na tuto problematiku vrhnout nové světlo, především proto, že se jedná o málo probádanou část výzkumu kreativity a genderových rozdílů.</p>\n<p>He a Wong (He, 2011) zkoumali rozdíly v kreativitě mezi 499 chlapci a 486 dívkami pomocí relativně nového testu kreativity <em>Test fir Creative Thinking – Drawing Production (TCT-DP)</em>, který byl konstruován na základě komponentního modelu kreativity německého profesora Klause K. Urbana. Test byl navržen tak, aby umožňoval holističtější pojetí kreativity, než nabízí klasické, kvantitativní testy divergentního myšlení (Urban, 2005). Test zahrnuje šest předkreslených figurálních fragmentů, které testovací subjekt musí libovolným způsobem rozvést a využít ve vlastní kresbě. Test je navržen tak, že výsledný kresby je možné hodnotit pomocí několika kritérií, mezi nimi například jsou <em>kompozice</em>, <em>elaborace</em>, <em>podstupování rizika</em>, <em>boření (konceptuálních) hranic či pravidel</em>, <em>nekonvenčnosti</em>, <em>afekce</em> a <em>humor </em>(Urban, 2005).</p>\n<p>Z hlediska genderových rozdílů použití TCT-DP neindikuje žádný rozdíl ve <em>střední hodnotě </em>výsledků mezi gendery a pouze minimální trend ve prospěch chlapců, který je relativně konzistentní napříč několika testovacích vzorků, ale statisticky nesignifikantní (Urban, 2005). He a Wong (He, 2011) reportují nesignifikantní genderové rozdíly mezi školáky prvních až sedmých ročníků a ve vzorku z Hong Kongu u studentů ve věku 12 až 16 let. v neposlední řadě je TCT-DP test byl mezi výzkumníky kreativity kladně přijat a je pokládán za validní test kreativity (He, 2011; Urban, 2005).</p>\n<p>He a Wong (He, 2011) jako první se pokusili podívat na genderové rozdíly v kreativitě prizmatem statistické variability (rozptylu) v distribuci výsledků. Třebaže v kontextu výzkumu kreativity genderových rozdílů se jedná o nový přístup, již od konce devatenáctého století víme, jak reportoval Ellis v roce 1894, že mužské pohlaví vykazuje větší variablitu v jak fyzických, tak mentálních charakteristikách (Ellis, 1974). He a Wong (He, 2011) citují výzkum, který nachází větší variabilitu u mužů v mechanickém uvažování, matematice, prostorovém zpracování, a u žen ve verbálním uvažování a krátkodobé paměti. Větší variabilita u mužů se také projevuje obecněji v mentálních schopnostech a u žen v sebevědomí.</p>\n<p>Větší mužskou variabilitu reportuje Hyde (Hyde, 2008) na vzorku amerických studentů v matematických testech. Zatímco jejich výzkum neprokázal žádné zásadní rozdíly v genderu ve střední hodnotě distribuce výsledků, nachází větší variabilitu chlapců <strong>ve všech testovaných školních ročnících (ročníky 2-11 v americkém školním systému)</strong>, pohybující se v poměru 1,11 až 1,21 ve prospěch chlapců. Mnohem zajímavější data jsou z kraje distribuce v 95 a 99 percentilu. Zde u bělošské populace nacházíme na 95 percentilu poměr 1, 45 ve prospěch chlapců a na 99 percentilu to je již 2,06. Pro asijskou populaci jsou však tyto výsledky odlišné: v 95 percentilu chlapci převyšují pouze v poměru 1,09 a <strong>na 99 percentilu dokonce asijské dívky mají větší zastoupení v poměru 1,09</strong>.</p>\n<p>Hedges (Hedges, 1993) pro testování hypotézi, že muži jsou více variabilní (tzv. Greater Male Variability hypothesis) užívá rozsáhlou baterii kognitivních testů viz (Hedges, 1993), včetně WAIS IQ testu v jeho celé škále. Výsledky jeho testů ukazují, že ve 22 případech z 28 muži převyšují ženy na pravé straně chvostu distribuce. v šesti případech jsou ženy více reprezentovány na pravém chvostu distribuce v testech hláskování, jazykových testech, rychlost a přesnosti klerikálních úkonů a “digit symbol” subtestu na WAIS IQ testu. v 15 případech je více mužů na levém chvostu distribuce a v 7 případech muži se vyskytují početněji na obou chvostech distribuce.</p>\n<p>Podíváme-li se na percentily, na 95 percentilu distribuce dovedností je více mužů na 6 z 28 testech v poměrů 2:1 (5 z nich jsou testy matematických, prostorových a mechanických dovedností). Na mechanickém uvažování je poměr 16:1. <strong>Na 99.9 percentilu distribuce je na 7 z 28 testů více mužů v poměru 5:1, kde na mechanickém uvažování je to v markantním poměru 236:1 a v matematickém testu 12:1. </strong>Údaje reportované Hedgesem jsou konzistentní s daty prezentované Pinkerem (Pinker a Spelke, 2005), který ukazuje přetrvávající znatelné rozdíly v mechanickém uvažování, prostorovém uvažování a matematických slovních problémech, kdežto u žen tvrdí, že excelují v matematické kalkulaci.</p>\n<p>He a Wong (He, 2011) dále citují známý skotský národní výzkum (zlatý standard testování kognitivních schopností dle Pinkera v Pinker a Spelke, 2005) z roku 1932, kde 95 % jedenáctiletých se zúčastnilo testování inteligence. Tento masivní test ukázal, že přestože mezi muži a ženami existuje v distribuci výsledků velké překrytí, muži mají větší zastoupení na obou chvostech distribuce. Laicky řečeno, distribuce ukazuje, že více géniů a “anti-géniů” je zastoupeno muži.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\" size-full wp-image-1034 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/scottish_mental_survey_1932.png\" alt=\"scottish_mental_survey_1932\" width=\"602\" height=\"390\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/scottish_mental_survey_1932.png 602w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/scottish_mental_survey_1932-300x194.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Obr. 1: Grafické znázornění rozdílné variability výsledků na IQ testu mezi gendery. Střední hodnota distribuce je stejná. (Scottish Mental Survey, 1932)</p>\n<p>Projeví se rozdílná variabilita i v testu kreativity? He a Wong (He, 2011) odpovídají ve svém článku, že ano. Na testu TCT-DP mají chlapci statisticky signifikantní větší variabilitu na 5 z 10 subvýsledků. v oblasti distribuce, která byla z ≥ 1, tedy 1 a více SD nad průměrem byl poměr ve prospěch chlapců 1,61 a pro z ≥ 2, tedy 2 a více SD nad průměrem pak 3,40. v centrální části distribuce kolem střední hodnoty pak bylo, dle predikce Greater Male Variability hypotézy více dívek. <strong>Autoři také zdůrazňují, že přestože našli statisticky nesignifikantní rozdíly v subtestech TCT-DP testu, v celkovém skóre nenašli statisticky signifikantní genderové rozdíly, čímž následují předchozí citovaný výzkum</strong>.</p>\n<p>He a Wong (He, 2011) tedy potvrzují, že i v testech kreativity, konkrétně v testu TCT-DP lze sledovat trend viditelný v ostatních doménách kognitivních dovedností, kde muži jsou genderem, který je více variabilní, a ženy genderem, který klustruje kolem střední hodnoty distribuce. Je nutné poznamenat, že samozřejmě rozdílná variabilita v distribuci dovedností v sobě zahrnuje geniální dívky, stejně tak jako průměrné muže. Rozdílná variabilita, jak píše Hedges (Hedges, 1993), má ale zásadní vliv na to, kolik talentovaných dívek a chlapců můžeme očekávat v nejvyšších úrovních dovedností. Hedges píše, že i když střední hodnotu distribucí dívek a chlapců na dané dovednosti je stejný, větší variabilita zaručuje, že například v 95 percentilu počet mužů v této části distribuce převýši počet žen. Samozřejmě za předpokladu, že uvažujeme normální, gaussovu distribuci (křivku). Větší variabilita ve zmíněných dovednostech je tedy silný kandidát na vysvětlení toho, proč v reálném kontextu světa vidíme genderové rozdíly v eminentní kreativitě. Bohužel nám ale Greater Male Variability hypotéza neříká nic o tom, proč rozdíly ve variabilitě existují. He a Wong (He, 2011) sice citují několik hypotéz identifikující příčiny v biologických, kulturně-historických či sociálně-environmentálních faktorech, ale jak tvrdí, většina z tohoto výzkumu je stále spekulativní, o to více v kontextu výzkumu kreativity, kde tyto faktory musí být prokázány, že hrají roli v kreativní produkci jednotlivců.</p>\n<h2>Shrnutí výzkumu genderových rozdílů v kreativitě</h2>\n<p>Většina citovaného výzkumu se shoduje na tom, že v psychometrických a behaviorálních testech kreativity mezi gendery neexistují statisticky signifikatní rozdíly. Na základě strukturálních rozdílů a odlišných kognitivních stylů, včetně odlišných silných a slabých stránek, výzkum ukazuje, že gendery nejspíše používají odlišné kognitivní strategie, vycházející z jejich kognitivních stylů, jak dosáhnout stejného kreativního výsledku.</p>\n<p>Genderové rozdíly dle výzkumu vidíme v dětské figurální kreativitě, kde gendery užívají jiných motivů, barev a kompozice. Dívky s genetickou poruchou kongenitální adrenální hyperplazie (KAH) vykazují na daném testu figurální kreativity velmi podobné, až stereotypicky maskulinní preference pro téma, barvu a kompozici, což indikuje možnost, že hormony mediují genderové rozdíly, nikoli socio-kulturní konstrukt “genderu” jako takového. Na hormonální vlivy genderových rozdílů navazuje text citací výzkumu Barona-Cohena, který ukazuje, že zvýšené prenatální množství testosteronu hraje roli ve vývoji autismu, který prostřednictvím své E-S teorie charakterizuje jako hypermaskulinní typ mozku, který vyniká v systematizování, ale má problémy s emaptizováním. Preference systematizace před empatizací se vyskytuje i u autistických dívek, čímž Baron-Cohen opět indikuje hormonální mediaci genderových rozdílů.</p>\n<p>Tento text dále cituje výzkum z neurověd, ve kterém pomocí funkční magnetické rezonance se na základě strukturálních odlišností mozku hovoří o možnosti toho, že genderyy užívají pro stejné výsledky odlišné části mozku, a tím také odlišné kognitivní styly a strategie.</p>\n<p>Citované výzkumy jsou ale kritizovány z řad nejen feministicky smýšlejících akademiků a akademiček, kteří poukazují na chybné metodologie a špatné interpretace dat, včetně nedostatečné znalosti současného výzkumu genderových studií a konceptu intersekcionality, které by dle některých autorů měly být doporučeným studiem pro všechny neurovědce, kteří chtějí kompetentně studovat genderové rozdíly.</p>\n<p>Nakonec tento text probírá Greater Male Variability hypotézu, která již přes sto let tvrdí, že muži vykazují větší variabilitu na mnoha kognitivních i dalších vlastnostech. Cituji hned několik autorů, kteří tuto hypotézu potvrzují, včetně značného rozdílu v mechanickém uvažování, které v nejvyšších percentilech na pravé straně chvostu distribuce této dovednosti indikuje, že muži mají zde převahu. Tato hypotéza byla také potvrzena i ve výzkumu kreativity, kde, přestože střední hodnota distribuce je u genderů stejná, pohled na stejná data skrze variabilitu genderové rozdíly odkrývá.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<h2>Diskuze: konsekvence genderových rozdílů v kreativitě?</h2>\n<p>V současné informační společnosti, jež zvýhodňuje jednotlivce, kteří jsou schopnosti nejen analyzovat komplexní informace, ale zároveň vytvářet informace nové. Imbesi (Imbesi) například tvrdí, že design, jakožto kreativní činnost, je jeden z mála oborů schopný vytvářet hodnoty, kterými se firmy a značky od sebe odlišují. Castells, Bell a další již dříve psali o tom, že schopnost vysoce abstraktní a technické manipulace s informacemi a generování nových informací jsou důležité pro život v informační společnosti. i proto potenciální genderové rozdíly mohou mít zásadní vliv na to, jak se v průměru budou manifestovat silné a slabé stránky jednotlivých genderů. Pokud se gendery v kreativitě a kognitivních stylech liší, znamená to, že v průměru muži a ženy přistupují k problémům odlišným způsobem. Abraham (Abraham, 2014) například uvádí, že pokud tomu tak je, konstitují takové genderové rozdíly možný argument pro aktivnější narovnání reprezentace žen v důležitých oborech s vlivem na společnost, neboť ženy (a z mého pohledu i muži vykazující stereotypicky femininní kognitivní styl) mohou přinést k řešení problémů novou dimenzi kognice a kreativity, která v prostředí, kde dominuje ryze stereotypicky maskulinní kognitivní styl, chybí.</p>\n<p>Zároveň by genderové rozdíly v kreativitě a kognici znamenaly, že pedagogické a edukační materiály by tyto rozdíly měly reflektovat tak, aby využívaly maximum potenciálu silných stránek jednotlivých genderů a pozvedly negativní aspekty jejich slabých stránek.</p>\n<p>V neposlední řadě by vývoj a design technologií, architektura a urbanistické plánování mohlo tyto rozdíly zahrnout, aby byly lépe přizpůsobené jednotlivým genderům.</p>\n<p>Uznání existence genderových rozdílů v kreativitě a kognici, pokud tak výzkum prokáže, by mohlo pozitivně ovlivnit současný diskurz existujících genderových diskrepancí, které z pohledu radikálního sociálního determinismu jsou výsledkem historické diskriminace a stále přetrvávajícího sexismu.</p>\n<p>Na druhou stranu jsem si vědom nebezpečí, které potvrzení genderových rozdílů představuje, neboť by mohlo sloužit jako pomyslný olej do ohně a v očích určitých jedinců mohlo představovat potvrzení všech stereotypů a volnou ruku v pokračování, nebo dokonce zesílení diskriminace na základě genderu. Racionální přístup by však znamenal, že přestože existují rozdíly v ve střední hodnotě nebo variabilitě distribuce, je logicky nesprávné přisuzovat všechny vlastnosti skupiny, ke které jednotlivec náleží, danému jednotlivci. Jinak řečeno, ať už genderové či jiné rozdíly v určitých sociálních skupinách existují, vždycky bychom měli jednat s jednotlivci na základě jejich konkrétních vlastností, nikoli podle hypotetických vlastností, získaných analýzou toho, k jaké sociální skupině daný člověk patří.</p>\n<p>Jsem však toho názoru, že svět je příliš komplexní “systém”, abychom si mohli dovolit sami sobě lhát, neboť nedokážeme predikovat, jak se ona lež ve světě projeví. Třebaže jsme měli dobré úmysly, můžeme milosrdnou lží napáchat více škody, než bychom zamýšleli. z citovaného výzkumu v tomto textu podle mého názoru vyplývá, že biologický vliv na genderové rozdíly je pravděpodobně větší než 0 %. Proto by výzkum, který se snaží odkrýt genderové biologické rozdíly nejen v kreativitě, měl být legitimní. Zároveň nelze přehlížet, že toto téma je ve středu mnoha politických debat, a tudíž téma, které vyvolává i mnoho záporných emocí na “obou” stranách pomyslného konfliktu. Proto souhlasím s Cine a ostatními, kteří volají potom, aby výzkum genderových rozdílů byl vědou aplikující nejstriktnější standardy pro evaluaci výsledků. i přes striktní standardy a peer-review proces ale vychází výzkum, u kterého se časem ukáží zásadní nedostatky. To, že ale výzkum genderových rozdílů v kreativitě obsahuje nedostatky nemůže a priori znamenat, že tyto nedostatky vznikly proto, že autoři výzkumu zastávají sexistické názory. Jak Cline volá po rigoróznějším výzkumu genderových rozdílů, měla by i kritika výzkumu sama vykazovat nejpřísnější kritéria, neboť nálepku “neurosexismus” nejen kritizuje metodologii výzkumu, ale zároveň implicitně říká, že daný výzkumník cíleně užil špatné metodologie, aby prosadil své politické cíle. Zde nezbývá než zmínit opět Baron-Cohena a jeho upozornění, že vědci mohou podporovat rovnost genderu a být proti jakékoli diskriminaci ve společnosti a zároveň zkoumat (i s nevyhnutelnými přehmaty a chybami) genderové rozdíly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\n</strong></h2>\n<h2>Zdroje:</h2>\n<p>ABRAHAM, Anna, 2016.

Vedle obligátních biblí interakčního designu od Alana Coopera, Dona Normana, teorie realistického designu od českého akademika působícího v Norsku Jana Michla, nastudování kognitivních aspektů interakce člověk-stroj, jsem zdůrazňoval i nutnost přestat číst většinu online blogů a být skeptický vůči webům typ Stack Exchange.</span> Mnohokrát jsem sám využil této online “kolektivní inteligence”, když jsem si nebyl jistý, zdali tlačítko OK a STORNO v modálním okně má být vpravo nebo vlevo. Mít živý online archív nejlepších praktik je užitečné. Vždyť další hojně citovaná literatura pro UX designéry, <em>A pattern language</em> od architekta a teoretika Christophera Alexandera, se snažila o totéž: demokratizovat disciplínu architektury tak, aby kdokoli mohl použít pro své projekty osvědčené praktiky, což byla podle Alexandera cesta, jak zkvalitnit architekturu a tím i životy lidí. Potud není třeba kuchařky rychlých receptů typu Stack Exchange jako zdroj UX vzdělání kritizovat.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jenže problém může nastat tehdy, pokud se praxe designérů omezí pouze na aplikování ověřených metod. Vytrácí se tím z designu to hlavní, proč designéři svou práci dělají: touha nacházet nové příležitosti, jak pomocí kreativního a promyšleného využití technologií lze zlepšit lidské životy. Navíc tím ale nutně trpí obor designu jako takový. Čím častěji se designéři budou uchylovat ke známému, ověřenému, bez hlubšího porozumění, proč dané řešení fungují, tím více se bude vytrácet z oboru inovativnost a kritické myšlení, jež jsou nutné pro regeneraci starých teorií a dogmat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Argument tržní ekonomiky a volného trhu myšlenek by nejspíše tvrdil, že přestože komerční sektor není nejpřátelštější k čistě teoretickému bádání a zkoumání, vždycky jde na trhu o profit, a pokud se dostanou designéři ke zkvalitnění a profitu svých produktů pomocí teoretické četby, jistě tak učiní. Nepochybně tomu tak do jisté míry může být. Není ale možné si myslet, že během komerční činnosti budou designéři zároveň zastávat či nahrazovat pozice akademických výzkumníků. Tyto role se mohou prolínat, a v teoreticko-prakticky orientované disciplíně jakou je design je to více než plodná kombinace, ale bylo by naivní si myslet, a hlavně historicky nesprávné, že je to predominantně trh, který přichází s inovacemi. Pro nové teorie je k trhu nutné paralelní, nekomerční univerzum v podobě akademického výzkumu, jehož hlavní náplní je intelektuální produkce, která poskytuje nové teorie i kritickou analýzu toho, co se děje v praxi. Jak víme, v dnešní době se může pod taktovkou digitálních velikánů jako Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon a dalších, akademický výzkum provádět i na neuniverzitní půdě. Ale i tito giganti spolupracují s jednotlivými akademiky nebo rovnou univerzitami. Mnoho oborů může z této symbiózy tržních pravidel a akademického výzkumu těžit. Jak je na tom UX design?</span></p>\n<h2>Intelektuální základ UX designu?</h2>\n<p>Pro UX design je specifické to, že vznikal rovnou v podmínkách komerčního prostředí a až ex-post se praktikující UX designéři začali poohlížet po nějaké intelektuální základně. V současné době je UX design právě kvůli svým nejistým počátkům stále pojmem s neukotvenou definicí, což může vyplývat také z toho, že je to obor, který plynule reaguje na nové technologie a požadavky trhu. V akademické sféře se ale již vyskytuje několik publikací, které se snaží zachytit, jak se UX design liší od příbuzných oborů interakčního designu a HCI. Literatura se shoduje, že UX design lze chápat jako obor, který:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>přesahuje pragmatické a utilitární požadavky tradiční HCI použitelnosti, která se snažila vědecky uchopit uživatelovu interakci s technologií jakožto určitého kognitivního výkonu, který je možný měřit a kvantifikovat. UX design zdůrazňuje hédonické, emoční, prožitkové, estetické aspekty a naplňování uživatelských cílů [HASSENZAHL a TRACTINSKY, VÄÄNÄNEN-VAINIO-MATTILA, LAW, ROTO, HASSENZAHL a kol.]</li>\n<li>je zakotven ve filosofii User-centered designu (UCD), která staví uživatele a jeho kontext použití, znalosti, kulturu do středu pozornosti celého cyklu designování [SWARD a MACARTHUR], čímž se právě od tradičního HCI liší tím, že místo technologického pohledu zaujímá lidskou perspektivu [HASSENZAHL a TRACTINSKY]</li>\n<li>je subjektivní a holistické [BATTARBEE a KOSKINEN, HASSENZAHL a TRACTINSKY]</li>\n<li>vyžaduje empatické porozumění a „vžití se“ do role uživatelů [BATTARBEE a KOSKINEN]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Již na začátku ale UX design v sobě zahrnoval důležité teoretické otázky, na které se pod tlakem deadlinů a dodání dobře vypadajících prototypů ve správném softwaru zapomíná. Byly to otázky, které předpovídaly mnohem intimnější vztah člověka a technologie, a zároveň představily, bez jakékoli hyperboly, filosofický problém: pokud designéři mají nějakým způsobem pozitivně ovlivňovat uživatelské zážitky a prožívání z technologií, co vůbec víme o lidském prožívání? Nebo jinak, co designéři musí vědět o <em>lidech </em>a <em>technologii</em>, aby mohli designovat <em>prožívání</em>? A je vůbec možné něco takového <em>designovat</em>?</p>\n<p>Pro původ těchto otázek je dobré si připomenout, kdy se o UX designu začalo mluvit. První zmínku lze vypátrat v roce 1986, kdy v již klasické knize <em>User Centered System Design: New Perspectives on Human-computer Interaction</em>, kterou editoval Don Norman se Stephenem Draperem, se objevil text <em>Interface as Mimesis</em> od Brandy Laurel. Pokud bychom ale chtěli najít moderní význam slova, dostaneme se opět k Donu Normanovi, který v jedné emailové korespondenci píše, že pojem UX design vymyslel v roce 1995, když pracoval jako HCI výzkumník ve společnosti Apple:</p>\n<p>„Vymyslel jsem tento termín, protože jsem považoval HCI a použitelnost za příliš omezující: chtěl jsem pokrýt všechny aspekty<strong> lidského prožívání</strong> se <strong>systémem</strong>, včetně průmyslového designu, grafiky, <strong>interface</strong>, fyzické <strong>interakce </strong>a manuálu.“ [MERHOLZ, Whither “User Experience”?, mé zdůraznění]</p>\n<p>Všimněme si v citaci několika věcí. Norman v roce 1995 rozeznává, že akademický obor HCI byl dlouho pod vlivem dominantního zaměření na <em>použitelnost, a </em>že neposkytuje potřebné intelektuální rámce a metodologie pro uchopení <em>lidského prožívání </em>technologií. A to prožívání i takové, které se netýká pouze užití hlavního produktu — například (informační) systému, ale též zdánlivě nesouvisejících částí a vlastností, které by dle Normana měl UX design brát v potaz. Norman vyjmenovává několik dalších “bodů kontaktů”, se kterými se uživatel během použití systému setká a co lze nazvat širším a nepřímým kontextem systému. Jeho výčet není vyčerpávající. Pro doplnění nás hned napadne například, že architektura a interiér prodejních míst nebo podoba televizní reklamy také ovlivňují, jakým způsobem prožíváme a přemýšlíme o technologiích. Celá idea marketingových kampaní je právě navodit správný image produktů podáním vybraných faktů a atraktivních vizuálů, kde funkce produktů ustupuje do pozadí, neboť je často stejná jako u konkurence, a co rozhoduje je prezentovaný narativ toho, jak se člověk-uživatel-zákazník může stát součástí nějaké komunity, která mu dodá do života význam.</p>\n<p>Reklama funguje mimo jiné i proto, že <em>lidské prožívání</em> málokdy musí odpovídat fyzické podobě světa: vidíme věci, které neexistují, sníme o tom, co nemáme apod. Náš život se neskládá jen ze souborů vědeckých faktů a logického vyvozování, ale i z bohatého (fenomenologického) vnitřního života, který je, Heideggerovsky řečeno, od začátku poznamenám tím, že se odehrává ve světě. Člověk nemůže ve světě stát na místě, musí jednat a k jednání je málokdy čas na logické dedukce; musí se orientovat ve světě podle nabytých zkušeností, intuice a spíše než k analýze každé situace a všech věcí se upírá k tomu, jaký <em>význam </em>věci a technologie, kterými je obklopen, pro něj mají nebo jaký jim přiřadí.</p>\n<h2>Martin Heidegger jako filosof designu</h2>\n<p>Jak je známo, Martin Heidegger, ústřední postava filosofického směru fenomenologie, také argumentoval ve svém magnum opus <em>Bytí a čas</em>, že věci se nám jeví spíše na základě významu, konkrétně jako nástroj nebo přesněji prostředek “ k něčemu” (in-order-to) než jako sada vlastností objektu, který před námi jen tak leží, aniž by na nás jakkoli působil. Konkrétně Heidegger pojmenoval dva způsoby toho, jak se nám věci jeví: <em>present-at-hand</em> (výskyt) a <em>ready-to-hand </em>(příručnost).</p>\n<p>První, méně běžnější způsob present-at-hand se podobá tomu, jak se na věci dívá vědec. Ten zkoumá věci objektivně, v izolaci od jejího přirozeného prostředí, analyzuje podrobně její vlastnosti a vše, co takový vědec může o dané věci říct, by byl velmi dlouhý seznam vlastností. Je to pohled, který představuje nezaujaté zkoumání věci, jako kdybychom sami sebe vyňali ze světa a dívali se na něj vědeckou optikou.</p>\n<p>Základní myšlenkou Heideggera ale je, že přesně tohoto vynětí ze světa nejsme schopni. Jsme vždy bytostmi, které existují ve světě a s námi i věci kolem nás. Proto druhým, podle Heideggera běžnějším způsobem, jak se nám věci jeví, je mód ready-to-hand. V takovém případě přistupujeme k věcem jako k prostředku, který nám nabízí nějakou funkci, kterou s ním můžeme vykonat. Ready-to-hand mód je součástí běžné každodennosti našich životů, kdy neteorizujeme, ale máme své cíle, které chceme pomocí prostředků vyplnit. Naše jednání je orientované na cíle (goal-oriented).</p>\n<p>Když člověk během dne potřebuje použít kladivo, neuvažuje o jeho fyzikálních vlastnostech, často si ani pořádně nevšimne, jaké je barvy. Co je pro něj důležité je fakt, že ví, k čemu kladivo jako nástroj je, a že mu poslouží k zatlučení hřebíku. Heidegger píše, že když se prostředek, například oblíbené kladivo, stane autenticky ready-to-hand (po ruce) [HEIDEGGER, 2006, §15 69/99], je pro něj charakteristické, “že se ve své příručnosti jaksi drží v pozadí, a to právě proto, aby bylo ve vlastním smyslu po ruce” [HEIDEGGER, 1996, §15 69/99]. Důležitým poznatkem dále je, že jakkoli dlouho se budeme na kladivo dívat, nikdy přesně nepoznáme jeho funkci, jeho příručnost. Pouze tehdy, když jej poprvé použijeme, budeme mít přístup k tomu, jaké to je používat kladivo. [HEIDEGGER, 2006, §15 69/98].</p>\n<p>Když naše práce s kladivem se obejde bez jakýchkoli problémů, nepřemýšlíme vědomě o kladivu ani hřebíku. Kladivo se pro nás stává transparentní. Čím více jsme ponořeni do naší práce, tím více také ztrácíme povědomí o nás samotných. Ve stavu, který bychom v současném výzkumu psychologie nazvali <em>flow</em>, tak jak jej popsal psycholog Mihaly Csikszntmihalyi, pak přestává platit jednoznačné oddělení nás, kladiva, hřebíku a práce. Fenomenologicky řečeno, ruší se rozštěp mezi subjektem a objektem; jediné co zůstává, je prožitek (experience) z daného úkonu. [ZALTA, 2017].</p>\n<p>V mnoha ohledech je to právě stav flow — tedy totální imerze do úkonu, bez toho, aniž bychom vnímali nástroje či interface, které používáme — jehož chceme UX designem dosáhnout. Na druhou stranu existují momenty, kdy naopak designér by měl přemýšlet nad tím, že jsou vhodné chvíle pro vědomé přerušení nepřetržitého toku prožívání, aby uživatele na něco upozornil. Nemusí to být nutně výstražné “alert upozornění” v oknu prohlížeče; stejně tak řidiče může vědomě upozornit dopravní značka či retardér na silnici.</p>\n<p>V obou případech musí designér myslet na to, že nové, kreativní produkty mohou být tak radikální, že uživatelé si nedokáží představit, jak s nimi zacházet, dokud si je sami nevyzkouší (viz výše ready-to-hand u Heideggera). I radikálně nový produkt by tak měl využívat naučených znalostí uživatelů a obsahovat na základě svého tvaru nápovědu o tom, jak daný produkt funguje, jak se ovládá, a tím pádem také, jaký pro daný kontext může být jeho význam a funkce. Akademická i popularizující designová literatura má pro tuto vizuální nápovědu termín <em>afordance</em>.</p>\n<h2>Afordance</h2>\n<p>Termín a<em>fordance </em>vyjadřuje existující i vnímané vlastnosti objektů, které uživatel rozeznává a umožňují mu vykonat nějakou činnost. Afordance zavedl Norman do HCI a designové komunity, když koncept převzal od významného psychologa Jamese J. Gibsona, který vytvořit tehdy neexistující podstatné jméno “affordance” ze slovesa “to afford” (poskytnout, umožnit), aby vyjádřil novou myšlenku: afordance jsou součástí jak prostředí tak i organismů a je nutné je analyzovat <em>relativně </em>k organismu  [GIBSON, 2015, s. 120], ačkoli mnohé afordance mohou být pro organismy stejné, pokud žijí ve stejné ekologické nice (niche). Afordanci lze tak spíše než fixní, statickou vlastnost chápat jako <em>vztah</em> mezi vlastnostmi prostředí a vlastnostmi organismu [NORMAN, 2013, s. 11], v kontextu designu například schopnostmi člověka interagujícího s objektem průmyslového designu nebo uživatelského rozhraní (interface). Afordance jsou jak fyzické, tak psychické, čímž přesahují karteziánský dualismus těla a mysli a subjekt-objektovou dichotomii. [GIBSON, 2015, s. 121]</p>\n<p>Jako prototypický příklad afordance se v literatuře uvádí držadlo u dveří. Svým vzhledem napovídá, jak je možné s ním zacházet a také, jakou funkci koná. Designem dveří a obecně objekty, se kterými máme každodenně až zbytečně velké problémy, se Norman zabývá ve své knize The design of everyday things (dříve také vydávana The psychology of everyday things). Norman v designové komunitě proslavil do té míry, že špatně nebo nesmyslně navržené dveře si vysloužily přezdívku “Norman doors” [NORMAN, 2013, s. 1].</p>\n<p>Konceptualizace afordance se ale u Normana a Gibsona přeci jen liší. Jak je známo, Gibson tvrdil, že afordance vnímáme přímo, bez nutnosti mediace přes symbolickou reprezentaci, tedy afordance objektů v prostředí vnímáme bez potřeby dané objekty klasifikovat do abstraktních, lingvistických kategorií. Jsou to právě afordance, které definují význam v našem prostředí. Afordance je pro Gibsona význam a pokud bereme doslova jeho tezi, že afordance vnímáme přímo, bez nějakého interpretačního meziprocesu, znamená to, že významy i hodnoty jsou mimo organismus, který afordance vnímá, jak píše Gibson, jsou vzhledem k pozorovateli externí. [GIBSON, 2015, s. 119]</p>\n<p>Je ale Gibson konzistentní? Respektive znamená to, že významy jsou nezávislé na pozorovateli? Že jen tak “leží” v našem prostředí a čekají na to, až si je někdo “vyzvedne” (Gibson používá v angličtině sloveso “to pick up”)? Jelikož Gibson odmítá subjekt-objekt dichotomii, musí být význam sdílen mezi pozorovatelem i prostředím. Vždyť Gibson sám tvrdí, že afordance jsou vždy relativní k pozorovateli, takže i význam musí být k pozorovateli relativní.</p>\n<p>Norman reaguje na Gibsonovu definici afordancí tak, že rozděluje afodance na dva typy: ty, které existují, aniž bychom je vnímali, a vnímatelné afordance. Tímto Norman explicitněji než Gibson formuluje tezi, že v prostředí existující a priori afordance, jejichž ontologický status není dán existující subjekto-objektovou relací, ale její <strong>pouhou potencialitou</strong>. Jinak řečeno, afordance nyní nejsou již pouze přímou percepcí afordancí, jak vehementně Gibson usuzoval, ale i všemi afordancemi, které potenciálně může organismus s kontaktu s prostředím vnímat.</p>\n<p>Za druhé se Norman radikálně odklání od původního významu afordancí tím, když nesouhlasí s hlavní Gibsonovou tezí, že afordance vnímáme přímo. Místo toho Norman tvrdí, že afordance je třeba interpretovat [NORMAN, 2013, s. 12]. Dle mého názoru právě tento ústup stranou od nutnosti umožňuje Normanovi rozdělit afordance na vnímatelné a neviditelné, protože ruší onu závislost přímé percepce. Zatímco ale ontologický status afordancí je u Gibsona triviální &#8211; existují v okamžiku, když je organismus v prostředí vnímá-, u Normana se existence afordancí komplikuje, zvláště proto, že jejich existence je už u Gibsona relativní k organismu. Norman jejich existence také relativizuje, a to tím, že argumentuje, že organismus musí nejdříve afordance <strong>interpretovat</strong>, aby je mohl vnímat. Vyvstává tak logická otázka: pokud afordance jsou vždy relativní k organismu, jak mohou afordance existovat, přestože je organismus nevnímá?</p>\n<p>Norman ve stručném článku na svém blogu [NORMAN, Affordances and Design] poznamenává, že zavedení afordancí se sice rychle ujalo v designové komunitě, ale často bylo misinterpretováno. Norman potíže s porozuměním svého pojetí afordancí přiznává a zároveň dodává, že měl spíše psát o “vnímatelných afordancích”, které jsou pro designéry mnohem zajímavější, neboť jsou to právě vnímatelné afordance, jež designéři zakomponovávají do svých výtvorů. Norman ale ve své práci, pokud je mi známo, nediskutuje ontologický status afordancí, které jsou neviditelné.</p>\n<p>Z mého pohledu je na teorii afordancí u Gibsona i Normana důležité, že jsou úzce propojené s významem věcí. Zároveň afordance, a tedy význam, je relativní k organismu, člověku, uživateli na základě jeho zkušenosti s danou “ekologickou nikou”, ve kterém žije. Jinak řečeno, afordance i význam jsou závislé na kontextu, společnosti i kultuře člověka. Jsou tedy do určité míry sociálně konstruované.</p>\n<h2>Zážitky jsou sociálně konstruované</h2>\n<p>Podobně jako afordance i již zmiňovaný význam věcí není něco, co najdeme pouze schované v útrobách programovacího kódu nebo materiálu nejnovějšího smartphonu. Význam není materiální, ale metafyzickou veličinou. Vytváří se až při čtení, intepretaci nebo interakci s textem, objekty či interface. Je kombinací materiálních vlastností, společenských zvyků, a životních zkušeností a dovedností lidí. Dokonce i čas a prostor, ve kterém čteme knihu nebo používáme smartphone, mohou výrazně ovlivnit to, co pro nás věci znamenají. Dříve odkládaná báseň v nás může poprvé vyvolat silné zážitky, neboť ji čteme po ztrátě milovaného osoby. Podobně smartphone se najednou stává pro nás významným životním společníkem, když se ztratíme na horách a při velmi špatném signálu se nám podaří zobrazit mobilní mapy či zavolat o pomoc.</p>\n<p>Otázky významu, afordance, a tím i uživatelských zážitků spojuje fakt, že jsou podle teorií symbolického interakcionismu, actor-network teorie, ale i třeba i výzkumu<a href=\"https://medium.com/p/d4f50e669fe4/edit\"> mentálních modelů</a> a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_%28psychology%29\"> schémat</a> v kognitivní psychologii inherentně<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism\"> sociálně konstruované</a>. To tvrdil i sociolog Herbert Blumer, žák G. H. Meada, a zakladatel sociologické teorie <em>symbolického interakcionismu. </em>Blumer a jeho následovníci zastávají názor, že “lidé jednají ve vztahu k věcem na základě významů, které pro ně věci mají a [v]ýznam těchto věcí je odvozen z interakce, která probíhá mezi člověkem a společností.” [Herbert Blumer, 2001].</p>\n<p>To znamená, že jakkoli se designér bude snažit svému dílu vštěpit jednoznačné vlastnosti, které by podle něj měly přispět, nebo dokonce determinovat pozitivní uživatelské zážitky, nikdy nedokáže postihnout životní historii jednotlivých uživatelů, ani sociální komplexitu, ve které jeho dílo po vypuštění do reálného světa bude existovat a která nevyhnutelně bude formovat, jak uživatelé budou k jeho dílu přistupovat a přemýšlet o něm. Nemusí ale vrhat ruce v beznaději do vzduchu. To, že si uvědomí, že designér nevládne božskými silami, může naopak pomoci se zaměřit na to, co designér <em>má možnost ovlivnit.</em></p>\n<p>I když designér nemá možnost designovat uživatelské zážitky, navrhuje takové produkty a interakce mezi člověkem a technologiemi, které dle jeho úsudku a zkušeností budou tvořit co nejlepší <em>kontext </em>pro vyvstání požadovaných uživatelských zážitků. K tomu je ovšem potřeba vědět, jaké parametry má vhodný kontext mít, a také <em>proč </em>uživatel vůbec chce daný produkt používat.</p>\n<h2>Město a Antropocén: svět jako médium a sociální systém</h2>\n<p>Otázka <em>proč? </em>je obecně jedním z neplodnějších nástrojů, které designér může zahrnout do svého repertoáru, neboť jej nenásilnou formu uvádí do složité a zároveň fascinující problematiky myšlení o designu, technologiích a společnosti. Ta ve zkratce zní přibližně následovně: jak se pod náporem chytrých, ambientních zařízení a autonomních agentů a deep-learning algoritmů mění vztah člověka k jeho technologickým výtvorům. A nevyhnutelně, jak se mění vztah člověka ke svému okolí, přírodě a obecně světu?</p>\n<p>Hranice mezi technickou, organickou, sociální a přírodní vrstvou se totiž stírají. Po oficiální deklaraci Stockholmského memoranda je interkonektivita mezi zmíněnými vrstvami natolik silná, že lidská intervence nyní ovlivňuje “všechny aspekty planetární ekologie, čímž se přírodní i ekologické systémy stávají sociálně ovlivněnými”. Naše planeta tak retrospektivně od začátku 19. století vstoupila do nové éry Antropocénu [JONES, 2014]. Éry, která je definována tím, že člověk a především jeho technologie ovlivňují a formují svět kolem sebe.</p>\n<p>V novomediální teorii a urbanistické sociologii se dále dozvídáme, že i menší jednotka na celoplanetární škále — město — , je jednotkou, kterou si nejen urbanisté, architekti, ale i designéři musí všímat. A to i proto, že v roce 2030 bude podle odhadů ve městech žít více než 60 procent světové populace. Město se stane v celoplanetární propojené síti důležitým styčným bodem, který bude tvořit “digitální městské panoráma” [DEUZE, 2015, s. 20], na jehož pozadí se bude definovat kvalita i množství interakcí mezi lidmi, technologiemi a přírodou. A tyto interakce neprobíhají pouze ve fyzickém prostoru města, neboť město, podobě jako člověk sám, se skládá z fyzické i digitální (virtuální) vrstvy, kterou tvoří mobilní aplikace, jež dokáží rozlehlost a komplexitu města redukovat na nejzajímavější body, které v aplikace jakoby užívají, neboť se najednou stávají interaktivní. Skrze aplikaci nám místa nabízí novým způsobem staré informace i zcela nové zážitky, jež by bez podpůrné digitální vrstvy v podobě aplikace město nikdy nemohlo nabídnout.</p>\n<p>Město je hybridním prostorem, kde “vnímání budov, čtvrtí a shonu pouličního života nelze vidět odděleně od přímé účasti médií” [DEUZE, 2015, s. 20]. Teoretici hovoří o městu jako o mediální infrastruktuře [DE JONG a SCHUILENBURG, 2006, s. 15], “stroji” založeném na zpracování informací či neukončeným a neustále přetvářeným prostorem, který je po vzoru moderních webových aplikací v permanentním stavu beta [DEUZE, 2015, s. 27].</p>\n<p>Přes svou zjevnou rigiditu je město jako hybridní fyzický-digitální celek kujným bodem komplexní celoplanetární sítě. Zvláště jeho digitální vrstva je neustále otevřena inovacím a designovým intervencím, které dokáží řešit technické i sociální problémy, jako jsme mohli vidět v českém prostředí na příkladu mobilní aplikace Záchranka, která záchranné službě pomáhá osobu lokalizovat i umožňuje rychle informovat o zdravotní situaci postižené osoby.</p>\n<p>Digitální intervence mohou mít i svou stinnou stránku. Aplikace jako Uber nebo Airbnb jsou často citovanými příklady. I když na začátku “pouze” s dobrými úmysly naplňují neukojenou poptávku, v pozdní fázi svého působení se na základě svého rozšíření mohou ukázat jako síly, které negativně ovlivňují fungování města. Může se jednat o disruptivní efekt na taxi služby v případě Uberu nebo citelné zvyšování cen dlouhodobých pronájmů a prohlubování efektů gentrifikace tak, jak pozorujeme v diskuzi o službě Airbnb.</p>\n<p>Pokud skutečně zmíněné efekty jsou neplánovanými konsekvencemi masivního užívání populární digitální platformy, bylo možné negativnímu dopadu na město a jeho obyvatele předejít? Jsou hlavními viníky technické, politické nebo sociální aspekty služby?</p>\n<p>Jelikož žijeme v době, kdy propojenost a srůstání člověka, technologie a světa není jen teoretickou otázkou, ale i praktickým problémem, je to také na designu, jakožto oboru, který uvádí nové produkty a služby na svět, aby se těmito otázkami zaobíral. Dříve bylo otázkou privilegií, velkého budgetu a designově orientovaných manažerů, aby se při vývoji nových produktů a služeb uvažovalo o jejich vlivu na uživatele. Nyní jakákoli nová služba, aplikace, webová stránka, která netriviálně zasahuje do společenského života lidí a města se stává novým uzlem komplexní, celoplanetární sociální sítě technologií, lidí a světa. Proto kritické uvažování o tom, co korporace, ale i Stát přivádí prostřednictvím designérů na svět, nemůže být privilegiem, ale nezbytným předpokladem. (UX) designér musí navrhovat pro věk Antropocénu, pro dobu, ve které sama města jsou médii. Jak by se měla ale technologie vytvářet, aby v komplexním, celoplanetárním sociálním systému nezpůsobila katastrofické následky? A jaké metody a teorie mají designéři komplexních systémů k dispozici?</p>\n<h2>HCI jako intelektuální základna UX designu</h2>\n<p>Odpovědi na tyto otázky by měl mimo jiné poskytnout obor Human-computer interaction. Historie oboru HCI sahá do počátků osmdesátých let, kdy se v relativně mladých oblastech osobních počítačů a interaktivní počítačové grafiky objevil požadavek na zjednodušení obsluhy těchto nových technologií tak, aby i nová cílová skupina domácích uživatelů byla schopna osobní počítače používat.</p>\n<p>Osmdesátá léta přinesla v odvětví interakce s počítačem nové techniky přímé manipulace objektů na monitoru, desktopového grafického uživatelského rozhraní, WYSIWYG editoru nebo interakce s myší. Ty byly vyvíjeny ve výzkumných centrech při univerzitě Standford a společnosti Xerox PARC v čele s průkopníkem Douglasem Engelbartem. Až v roce 1984 se ale společnosti Apple podařilo svým počítačem Macintosh tyto novinky poprvé představit širší veřejnosti. Další systémy společností IBM a Microsoft následovaly.</p>\n<p>V roce 1982 byla založena skupina ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI), která byla propojena jak s akademickou sférou, tak i průmyslem. Skupina zdůrazňovala výzkum zaměřený na uživatele. V roce 1983 první konferenci na téma HCI navštívilo více než 1000 lidí. V následujících letech vyšly zásadní publikace jako <em>The psychology of Human-Computer Interaction</em> (S. K. Card, A. Newell a T. P. Moran, 1983), <em>Understanding computers and cognition: a new foundation for design </em>(T. Winograd a  F. Flores, 1986) a dříve zmíněná kniha Normana a Drapera <em>User centered system design: new perspectives on Human-Computer Interaction.</em>  [ROUSELL, 2014]</p>\n<p>Obor HCI již od svého počátku byl multidisciplinární a ovlivněn metodami a teoriemi příbuzných oborů, mezi které patřily především počítačová a kognitivní věda. A právě kognitivní věda, která sama čerpala z psychologie, lingvistiky, filosofie mysli a antropologie, udávala na následující roky HCI výrazný směr zaměřený na inženýrství použitelnosti (usability engineering) a kognitivní aspekty použití informačních systémů a počítačů.</p>\n<p>Později sice HCI začala čerpat nově i z alternativních teorií a oborů jako activity teorie, actor-network teorie nebo fenomenologické analýzy situačních a vtělených aspektů interakce, jež jsou dnešními teoretiky označované souhrnně jako post-kognitivistické [KAPTELININ, 2003]. Než se tak stalo bylo HCI v zajetí paradigmatu kognitivních věd. K pochopení nástupu post-kognitivních přístupů je dobré se podívat na nedostatky přístupu kognitivních věd, na které post-kognitivní teorie reagují, tzv. kognitivismu.</p>\n<h2>Nedostatky první vlny HCI a kognitivismu</h2>\n<p>Čím více technologie se stávala součástí každodenních životů lidí, tím více se začaly postupně projevovat limity první, tzv. kognitivní vlny oboru HCI. Ukázalo se, že motivace, cíle a uživatelské zážitky a komplexní interakce lidí i neživých objektů nelze studovat pouze prostřednictvím analýzy kognitivních aspektů myšlení člověka v umělém prostředí laboratoří.</p>\n<p>HCI výzkumníci i designéři se začali zajímat o to, <em>kde </em>a <em>kdy</em> člověk-uživatel s technologií přichází do styku, jaké jsou jeho motivace a cíle, a v neposlední řadě i zkoumání toho, jaký je dnešní svět, ve kterém uživatelé, stroje, interakce, interface existují. Metody a teorie první, kognitivní vlny HCI jsou k takovému zkoumání nedostačující. Proto se teoretici HCI a designu začali poohlížet jinde. Logickým krokem bylo začít brát vážně argumenty alternativních teorií v samotné kognitivní vědě. HCI dále začalo čerpat ze sociálních i humanitních věd, především ze sociologie, antropologických metod, teorie designu pro komplexní systémy i filosofie. Právě filosofie zasadila <em>kognitivismu </em>v kognitivní vědě, psychologii, výzkumu umělé inteligence a HCI zřejmě největší ránu.</p>\n<p>Kognitivismem se myslí teorie a předpoklady vyplývající z tzv. klasického nebo kognitivního výzkumného programu v kognitivní vědě, umělé inteligenci a filosofie mysli, které konceptualizují lidskou mysli pomocí metafory digitálního počítače. Paradigma kognitivismu chápe myšlení následovně:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>jako schopnost řešení problémů na základě vstupních a výstupních “dat”</li>\n<li>předpokládá existenci symbolického zpracování, kódování do určité formy reprezentace a komputace s těmito symboly a reprezentacemi</li>\n<li>zastává názor, že kognici lze porozumět primárně zaměřením na interní kognitivní procesy organismu zahrnuté v komputaci a reprezentaci [COWART]</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Kognitivismus ve zkratce předpokládá, že mentální stavy a inteligenci lze chápat jako manipulaci s abstraktními symboly a následování fixních formálních pravidel. [BREY, c2001, s. 41].</p>\n<p>Mezi předními odborníky kognitivistického přístupu k modelaci umělé inteligence patřili Herbert Simon, Alan Newell či Marvin Minsky. Jejich práce se sice lišila v tom, jak moc důvěřují tomu, že jejich výzkum modeluje skutečně lidskou inteligenci (Minsky bral výzkum AI “pouze” jako teoretický příspěvek ke studiu lidské kognice), ale v hlavní bodě se shodovali: pro klasické paradigma kognitivní vědy, také označované jako “symbolické AI”, jsou veškeré inteligentní procesy, včetně vnímání, myšlení, kalkulace, a použití jazyka, druhem <em>informačního zpracování</em>, tedy získání informace z prostřední, její zpracování nebo manipulaci a poskytnutí příslušné reakce [BREY, c2001, s. 39]. Aby informace mohla být zpracována, musí být nějakým způsobem <em>reprezentována: </em>obrazem, zvukem nebo právě symboly nějakého jazyka, ideálně takového, který je formální a skládá se z konečné množiny nezávislých elementů [DREYFUS, 1967, s. 14]. Po příchodu digitální komputace se touto množinou stal de facto exkluzivně jazyk binárních čísel.</p>\n<p>Požadavek na formálnost jazyka si s sebou nese jednu důležitou vlastnost: výzkum symbolické AI vidí informační zpracování čistě na základě formy symbolů, nikoli jejich významu. Když počítač zpracovává symbol “pes”, dále převedený do binární soustavy, ví, co se symbolem má dělat nikoli na základě jeho významu, ale pouze jeho formy [BREY, c2001, s. 40]. Předpoklad, že veškeré znalosti lze převést do formální podoby, bez nutnosti brát v potaz význam, respektive kontext, je filosofickým a priori jádrem výzkumu symbolické AI. Jádrem, které americký filosof a odborník na Heideggerovu fenomenologii, Hubert Dreyfus, začal počátkem 70. let ostře kritizovat.</p>\n<h2>Hubert Dreyfus a kritika kognitivismu</h2>\n<p>Nejdůležitější kritika, kterou Dreyfus směruje proti symbolické AI, je fakt, že inteligentní chování nezahrnuje pouze znalost určitých faktů, ale také znalost, jak tyto fakta aplikovat v <em>relevantní situaci</em> v myšlení, komunikaci či chování. Podle Dreyfuse tak znalost toho, že oheň je horký, zároveň zahrnuje i schopnost vhodně s ohněm zacházet. [BREY, c2001, s. 43] Pokud ale symbolické AI má být skutečně formální, na kontextu nezávislé, musejí být předem všechny relevantní situace v systému naprogramované, případně musí systém mít taková fixní pravidla, která dokáže na všechny dané situace vhodně reagovat. Zdá se ale nepravděpodobné, že by bylo možné předem vyjmenovat všechny relevantní situace, na které má systém reagovat. Odhlédneme-li od pár výjimek, které představují idealizovaný “svět”, jež symbolické AI umí řešit dobře, například matematické a formálně logické problémy, vhodná interpretace a reakce se vždy váže na kontextuální faktory.</p>\n<p>Brey [BREY, c2001, s. 33] ukazuje problém kontextu pro symbolické AI na příkladu interpretace věty přirozeného jazyka. Máme si představit anglickou větu, ve které se vyskytuje slovo “hot”. V angličtině slovo “hot” může znamenat “horký”, “pálivý” a ve slangové řeči také “fyzicky atraktivní”. Abychom byli schopni větu správně pochopit, musíme se podívat, v jakém kontextu je dané slovo použito. Někdy stačí se podívat na celou větu. V ostatních případech je třeba analyzovat větší celky jako odstavce. Podobně interpretace významu svazku květin, které leží na stole vedle alkoholických lahví, záleží na tom, při jaké příležitosti a komu byly květiny uděleny. V jednu chvíli se může jednat o květiny svatební, pohřební nebo jen náhodně nalezené květiny v parku. Oba příklady poukazují na to, že analýza samotných symbolů —</p>\n<p>květin — , bez okolního kontextu nestačí ke zjištění jejich významů.</p>\n<p>Problém kontextu dále lze ukázat na situaci, která je obecně blízká designérům. Je to chvíle, kdy designér se poprvé pouští do kreativní části projektu. Má před sebou všechna možná fakta získaná etnografickým výzkumem, SWOT analýzou a dalšími metodami patřícími do analytické fáze designového procesu. Pomocí těchto faktů má svou kreativitou vytvořit něco nového, co bude vhodným řešením pro zadání. Potíž je v tom, že designové problémy jsou definované, pokud vůbec, velmi vágně a v mnoha ohledech je na designérovy, aby rozhodl, co je <em>skutečný problém</em> daného projektu. To, že klient tvrdí, že potřebuje novou vizuální identitu nebo lepší web, totiž ve skutečnosti nemusí být ideální řešení toho, že produkt klienta špatně komunikuje své přednosti, případně to není chybou webu, že klient zaznamenává poslední dobou pokles objednávek. Viníkem může být špatná komunikace na sociálních sítích, která přílišnou vulgaritou nebo naopak formálností odpuzuje zákazníky. Zodpovědný designér chápe, že designový problém musí zasadit do širšího kontextu všech zákazníkových služeb a bodů kontaktu, se kterými zákazníci interagují.</p>\n<h2>Intuice a “problém” designových problémů</h2>\n<p>Jak bylo řečeno výše, povahou designových problémů je, že jsou špatně definovatelné, a tím pádem velmi těžko dostupné k formalizaci. Takové typy problémů si v odborné literatuře vysloužily jméno <em>wicked problems</em>. Ty jsou <em>wicked, </em>protože na rozdíl od problémů, které velmi pohodlně dokáže řešit symbolické AI, wicked problémy nemají jasně definované zadání, a tím ani řádnou definici řešení. Teoretik designu Horst Rittel ve svém článku zabývajícím se sociálním politikou, kterou celou definoval jako wicked problém, vyjmenovává společné vlastnosti všech wicked problémů [RITTEL, 1973]:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Neexistuje jejich definitivní formulace</li>\n<li>Není jasné, kdy dosahujeme konce jejich řešení (na rozdíl od matematických či šachových problémů, kde jednoznačně víme, zda jsme dosáhli požadovaného řešení problému)</li>\n<li>Na rozdíl od dobře strukturovaných problémů neexistuje ani pevně daný výčet potenciálních řešení, ani definované přípustné operace, jež vedou k řešení problému</li>\n<li>Řešení wicked problémů nejsou dichotomie správný/nesprávný, ale vhodný/nevhodný</li>\n<li>Každý wicked problém je unikátní, což u Rittela znamená, že neexistují jasně dané třídy problémů</li>\n<li>Řešení jedné části problému často vede k problémům novým</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lapidárně řečeno, u wicked problémů a obecně kreativních problémů poznáváme, že “nalezení problému je to samé jako nalezení řešení; wicked problém není možné definovat, dokud nenalezneme řešení” [FERENC, 2015, s. 54].</p>\n<p>Dreyfus se sice wicked problémy přímo nezabývá, ale jeho termín <em>ill-defined problems </em>svou povahou mi skutečně připomínají, co designová literatura právě zná pod pojmem <em>wicked problems</em>. Jaké konkrétní potíže tento typ problémů představuje pro kognitivismus a symbolické AI?</p>\n<p>Dreyfus píše, že “jelikož neexistuje limit pro množství dat, která mohou být relevantní pro řešení špatně definovaného problému [ill-defined], <em>nemůžeme ani v principu</em> zkusit všechny permutace možných dat pro nalezení řešení. V takovém případě totiž musíme nejen rozhodnout, jaké operace povedou k tíženým transformacím, ale také která fakta z celého kontextu jsou relevantní”. [DREYFUS, 1967, s. 23]</p>\n<p>Jakým způsobem řeší wicked problémy lidé, kreativci, designéři? Rittel ve své práci <em>The Reasoning of Designers</em> navrhuje pojetí designového myšlení jako argumentaci. Designér u Rittera pracuje na wicked problému tak, že „debatuje“ sám se sebou. Hledá výhody a nevýhody každého svého postupování. Svůj další postup nevolí na základě logické pravdivostní hodnoty, ale rozhoduje se s přihlédnutím na <em>vhodnost </em>[FERENC, 2015, s. 54].</p>\n<h2>Praktická inteligence</h2>\n<p>Právě schopnost najít vhodné, relevantní, nikoli nutně logicky správné řešení pro daný kontext zmiňuje Dreyfus jako jednu z důležitých strategií, kterou lidé užívají při řešení wicked problémů. Podle Dreyfuse řešení typu těchto problémů vyžaduje zdravý selský rozum (common sense) a intuici. Potřeba praktické, common sense inteligence je centrálním argumentem, co se do literatury výzkumu umělé inteligence zapsalo jako tzv. “frame problém”.</p>\n<p>Dreyfus vzpomíná na to, jak Marvin Minsky a další odborníci byli přesvědčení, že pokud umělá inteligence bude mít v paměti milióny informací a faktů o jednotlivých objektech svého prostředí, dokáže se rozhodnout o tom, jaké objekty jsou relevantní. Například v situaci, kdy počítač má v paměti uloženou reprezentaci nějaké 3D scény, ve které se něco změní. Aby počítač dokázal rozhodnout, čeho si má všímat nebo co je třeba přepočítat, musí mít nějaké kritérium relevance.</p>\n<p>Jenže takové kritérium je úzce spjato s prostředím a kontextem, ve kterém se počítač zrovna nachází [LEIDLMAIR, 2009, s. 41]. Minsky navrhl tento problém vyřešit tak, že se pro umělou inteligenci vytvoří stovky nebo tisíce prototypických případů kontextů, jež budou mít nějaké obecné vlastnosti a zároveň předpisy pro detekci relevantních faktů a také pro to, jak se v daném případě má systém umělé inteligence chovat. Minsky tento předpis nazval <em>frame</em>. Dreyfus si všímá, že se Minsky nejspíše inspiroval u Husserla, který podobnou strukturu předpisu též nazýval “frame” [LEIDLMAIR, 2009, s. 41].</p>\n<p>Výzkumníci AI se ale frame problému nezbavili. Výběr samotného “frame” předpokládá, že bude opět dostupné nějaké kritérium, které vybere pro daný kontext vhodný frame. Frame problém nezmizel, jen se posunul o jednu úroveň výše. Místo nalezení relevantního framu by bylo nyní potřeba najít meta-frame, který by definoval vhodný frame. Lze tak říci, že problém se ztrácí v zacyklené smyčce nekonečného regresu. [SHANAHAN, 2016]</p>\n<p>Heideggerovská myšlenka holistického světa, kdy na nás ze všech stran “září” významy (a afordance) vede navíc k tomu, že i když se něco v daný okamžik jeví nerelevantní a umělá inteligence by mohla s velkou pravděpodobností zvolit pro daný okamžik vhodný frame, nikdy nejsme a priori s to říci, že později v čase se to, co jsme explicitně ignoroval, se relevantní pro naše rozhodnutí nakonec nestane. [SHANAHAN, 2016]</p>\n<p>Svět nemá dopředu určené limity. Má inherentně otevřený konec. Což jsou podmínky, se kterými si lidská inteligence dokáže praktickým, selským rozumem poradit. Právě otevřenost a apriori nekonečné množství relevantních, kontextuálně závislých a propojených částí systému jsou vlastnosti, jimiž lze popsat i zmiňované superkomplexní wicked problémy, pro jejichž řešení jsou zkušení designéři vhodně vybaveni.</p>\n<p>Teoretik designu Nigel Cross si svým výzkumem práce profesionálních designérů všímá, že zkušení designéři se od amatérů výrazně liší tím, že jsou schopni plynule přecházet od formulace designového problému k jeho řešení, že v záplavě možných způsobů, jak přistoupit k problému rychle nachází strategie, které vedou k vhodnému cíli. Tyto strategie akademik a opět teoretik designu Bryan Lawson pojmenovává jako “gambity”, určité osvědčené vzorce, které se na základě zkušeností osvědčily v minulosti a jež jsou součástí stálého repertoáru designéra. Lawson si termín “gambitu” vypůjčuje z terminologie šachu, kde se jedná o tah, který je v dané situaci vhodný. [FERENC, 2015, s. 58]</p>\n<p>Lidská schopnost z potenciálně neomezeného množství informací, faktů a dostupných afordancí vybrat ty vhodné, a v případě zkušených designérů vybrat i takové, které vedou k nové, kreativní činnosti, je něco, čím se lidská kognice zásadně liší od praktik symbolické IA a tím i paradigmatu lidské mysl jako informační jednotky zpracovávají a reprezentující symboly.</p>\n<p>Dreyfusova kritika, založená na čtení Heideggera, pozdního Wittgensteina a jeho  a také Merleau-Pontyho, spočívá v tom, že pokud výzkumníci AI chtějí aspoň na teoretické úrovni vyřešit “frame problém”, musí začít implementovat vizi, kde bytosti vykazující inteligenci na úrovni té lidské formují své cíle, intencionalitu, a tím pádem i relevanci akcí na základě úzkého propojení prostředí světa a tělesnosti bytostí. Proto bylo nutné se podrobněji podívat na to, jak tělo ovlivňuje naší kognici, tvorbu konceptuálních schémat a také, jak tělesnost determinuje naše vnímání světa. Tyto otázky začal řešit nový výzkumný program, který se souhrnně nazývá <em>vtělená kognice</em>, <em>situovaná kognice</em>, <em>distribuovaná</em> č <em>rozšířená kognice</em>. <em> </em></p>\n<h2>Situovaná, vtělená a distribuovaná kognice versus Descartes</h2>\n<p>Výzkum vtělené kognice a úzce souvisejících programů situovaná kognice, distribuované č rozšířené kognice reagují na nedostatky kognitivismu tím, že berou v potaz, že myšlení není oddělené od těla ani od prostředí, ve kterém se tělesná bytost nachází. Obecně výzkum vtělené kognice argumentuje, že kognitivní procesy se vyvíjí, když na cíl orientované interakce mezi organismem a jeho prostředím dávají vzniknout úzce propojenému systému mezi myslí, tělem a prostředím. [COWART]</p>\n<p>Fenomenologická kritika kognitivismu a koncepty jako situovanost a vtělenost lidské kognice se radikálně odklání od stavebních kamenů západního filosofického myšlení <em>racionalismu</em>, které jsme zdědili ze 17. století od francouzského filosofa René Descartese. Descartes ve své Meditace o první filosofii analyzuje, co může na tomto světě prohlásit za skutečně jasné a reálné. Svou metodou extrémního skepticismu zavrhuje vše, co přichází do jeho vědomí skrze smysly, zavrhuje tělo, tvar rozlehlost a místo jako chiméry [DESCARTES, 2003, s. 27]. Zároveň tím také zpochybňuje, že externí svět by mohl být vhodným zdrojem pravdivých informací. Když Descartes dále pokračuje svou metodou, dochází k závěru, že jediná věc, kterou si může být skutečně při svém pochybování jistý je, že zde existuje on sám, který zpochybňování provádí. Zde se rodí známý aforismus <em>myslím, tedy jsem</em>.</p>\n<p>Pro Descartese mysl nepotřebuje ke svému fungování tělo. Mysl (res cogitans, věc myslící) a tělo (res extenza, věc rozprostraněná) jsou dvě odlišné substance. Přestože odlišné pojetí těla a mysli (duše) vidíme již v antické filosofii u Platóna a jeho říši ideálních Forem, na které se musíme rozpomenou, nebo v křesťanské metafyzické nauce o nesmrtelné duši, je to právě Descartovo rozdělení, které ve filosofii ustanovilo dualismus těla a mysli.</p>\n<p>Současná věda, včetně kognitivní vědy, karteziánský dualismus zavrhuje. Většina vědců dnes chápe mysl jako proces, který je sice komplikovaný, ale můžeme jej nakonec vysvětlit pomocí fyzických mechanismů, aniž bychom se odvolávali na ezoterické teorie. Věda tak zastává filosofickou pozici materialismu. Na druhou stranu tím, že materialistické pojetí kognitivní vědy ve šlépějích Descartese stále odmítá přisoudit tělu větší roli při konstituci myšlení, podobá se karteziánskému dualismu více, než by byla ochotna připustit. Symbolické AI se podobá spíše určité syntéze kartezianismu a materialismu. [DAWSON, 2013, s. 59]</p>\n<p>Situovaná a vtělená kognice jsou v rozporu s karteziánským oddělením těla a mysli. “Vtělená” kognitivní věda, která čerpá z těchto konceptů, explicitně opouští netělesnou mysl. Cíl kognice a inteligence člověka nevidí jako tvorbu správné reprezentace světa, ale jako sled akcí, které reagují na praktické problémy ve světě kolem nás. Vtělená kognitivní věda argumentuje, že teorie musí zahrnout nejen tělo člověka do analýzy kognice, ale také jeho prostředí a <strong>zážitky z tohoto prostředí</strong>. Zážitky závisí na situovanosti v daném prostředí, jak je prostředí vnímáno smysly.</p>\n<p>Situovanost ve vtělené kognitivní vědě znamená schopnost člověka nebo obecně konatele vnímat svět prostřednictvím svých smyslů. Zároveň ale kriticky záleží na fyzické podobě konatele, včetně struktury jeho fyzického těla. [DAWSON, 2013, s. 216] Lawrence Shapiro mezi klíčovými tématy vtělené kognitivní vědy rozeznává tzv. konceptualizaci, což je téma, kterým Shapiro vysvětluje, že člověk nabývá konceptů pro interakci s prostředím na základě podoby těla konatele. Pokud mají konatelé jiná těla, bude se jejich porozumění stejnému prostředí lišit. [SHAPIRO, 2011 citováno v DAWSON, 2013, s. 209].</p>\n<p>Vtělenost a situovanost kognice se samozřejmě odkazují na původní myšlenky Heideggera a jeho analýzu bytí-ve-světě, díky kterým můžeme Heideggera považovat za prvního teoretika vtělené interakce a tím pádem také, dle mého názoru, teoretika HCI/interakčního/UX designu. Připomeňme si, že Heidegger argumentoval, že v každodenním životě se nesetkáváme se světem jako světem abstraktních vlastností, který je pro nás zbaven významu, jež musíme neustále re-konstituovat na základě nekonečného proudu smyslových dat. Místo toho je pro nás svět již předem strukturovaný známými významy. [CHOKR, 2014, s. 178]</p>\n<p>Teoretici vtělené kognitivní vědy by ale poznamenali, že i když je pro nás svět předem strukturovaný, stále naše mysl v reálném čase při interakci se světem provádí aktivní výběr toho, co je přímo relevantní, a to v závislosti právě na vytyčených cílech, úkonech, těle, ale i aktuálnímu kontextu, prostředí, ve kterém se nacházíme. [COWART]</p>\n<p>Výzkum vtělené kognitivní vědy přímo vybízí k tomu se zamyslet, jak její poznatky mohou ovlivnit teorii a praxi designu a konkrétně designu zaměřeného na zážitky v komplexních, heterogenních systémech, které se skládají z mnoha fyzických i digitálních komponent.</p>\n<p>Dosud jsem se zabýval tím, že je to tělo a prostředí, které formuje naší kognici, naše cíle a úkony, které se nám v dané situaci zdají relevantní. Jinak řečeno, v prostředí nacházíme afordance, které nám pomáhají <em>nacházet problémy k řešení</em>, ale také je vyřešit. Vtělenost je již významným odklonem od kognitivistického chápání mysli, přesto mnoho dalších teoretiků nyní zachází ještě dále a domnívají se, že prostředí ovlivňuje kognitivní zpracování člověka tak zásadním způsobem, že hovoří o tom, že lidská mysl “prosakuje do světa” [DAWSON, 2013, s. 208]. Což je pozice přijata teoriemi distribuované či také rozšířené mysli představené Andy Clarkem a známým filozofem Davidem Chalmersem. V takovém pojetí lidská mysl se nenachází pouze v kůži nebo lebce, ale: “mysl je orgánem, který prosakuje, neustále uniká svým ‘přirozeným’ bariérám a nestydatě se míchá s tělem a světěm” [CLARK, 1998, s. 53].</p>\n<p>Andy Clark a David Chalmers ve svém významném článku <em>The extended mind</em> argumentují, že bychom měli brát vážně myšlenku, že okolní prostředí je důležité pro naší kognici, tak že bez nástrojů a technologií bychom nebyli schopni určitých kognitivních úkonů. Clark a Chalmers tvrdí, že některé kognitivní stavy jako paměť nebo domněnky mohou být realizovány mimo naše tělo pomocí nějakých vhodných externích elementů. Pokud tyto kognitivní stavy jsou závislé na dostupnosti těchto externích elementů, Clark a Chalmers argumentují, že organismus a tyto elementy jsou pro vybrané kognitivní stavy kauzálně nutné, a proto tvoří neoddělitelnou jednotu, jakýsi kognitivní ekosystém.</p>\n<p>Clark a Chalmers uvádí případ, kdy člověk má problémy s pamětí. Může přemýšlet pouze nad tím, co má zapsáno v zápisníku. Pokud ve svém zápisníku má napsáno, že Vinohradská ulice je v centru Prahy a pouze a jen na základě svého deníku <strong>věří</strong>, že tomu tak je, lze říci, že prostředkem jeho kognitivních procesů je právě zápisník a spolu tvoří kognitivní ekosystém. Neznamená to, že by zápisník sám nabýval mentálních stavů, zápisník nemá vědomí, ale funguje jako externalizace paměti v mozku, u které dnes nekontroverzně předpokládáme, že je nutná pro naše mentální stavy.</p>\n<p>Použijeme-li další příklady ze současnosti, kromě Google a mobilních telefonů je užitečným příkladem více a více komerčně dostupná technologie pro virtuální a rozšířenou realitu, kterou lze navázat na příklad s hrou Tetris, jež Clark a Chalmers v původním článku Extended mind zmiňují. VR nebo AR technologie umožňují lidem libovolně manipulovat v prostoru s 3D objekty, což je činnost velmi užitečná pro architekty, designéry nebo inženýry, kteří často ve své práci využívají počítačového softwaru pro vizualizaci extrémně složitých 3D objektů. Vidět ovšem nehotový návrh v reálném prostoru, tak jak to technologie rozšířené reality umožňuje, velmi snižuje nároky na představivost a pomáhá zasadit testovací prototypy projektů do reálného budoucího kontextu. Takové vizualizace jsou jen těžko představitelné pro běžného člověka. Technologie je ale zpřístupňují masové populaci. Jelikož schopnost mentální rotace s 3D objekty patří k jedné ze dvou hlavních složek IQ testu, jež jsou stále považovány za nejpoužívanější aproximaci tzv. g faktoru lidské inteligence, je možné říct, že zvýšení této schopnosti, prostřednictvím mediace nových médií a technologií, může mít dopad nejen na profesionály využívající tuto technologii pro svou práci, kde jim tato technologie umožní zrychlit stávající procesy, ale zároveň mění člověka jako takového.</p>\n<p>Podobně jako například vynález písma a později i knihtisku nepochybně ovlivnil strukturu a evoluci lidského myšlení, kultury a společnosti, tak i nové technologie, <strong>rozšiřující naše kognitivní schopnosti</strong>, mají a budou mít dopad na společnost i to, čeho jako lidé jsme schopni.</p>\n<p>Kognitivismus zastává názor, že pro lidské myšlení nehraje tělo, sociální kontext a lidské technologické nástroje a artefakty velkou roli. Stručné shrnutí kritiky kognitivismu ze strany nových přístupů v kognitivní vědě a filosofii ale ukazuje, že tomu tak není. To si pochopitelně žádá reflexi i v oborech HCI, interakčního designu a UX designu, které se v dnešní době podílí na formování technologických artefaktů v naší společnosti. Technologické artefakty nejen formují společnosti na povrchní úrovní, ale také na mnohem intimnější úrovni. Jak zastávají teoretici právě probraných přístupů k rozšířené kognici, HCI akademici a UX designéři musí do svého repertoáru myšlení, metod a teorií nutně zahrnout fakt, že tělo, sociální kontext a technologické nástroje se významně podílí na tom, jaký máme vztah ke světu. Člověk, technologie a svět netvoří oddělené sféry, ale jsou vzájemně propojenými částmi holistického celku.</p>\n<h2>Technologie jako médium: důsledky odmítnutí kognitivismu pro HCI a design?</h2>\n<p>Role technologie v takto holisticky pojatém světě nemůže být neutrální, ani pasivní. Technologie hraje aktivní úlohu ve formování našeho vztahu ke světu. Technologie je <em>médiem</em>. A médium není neutrální. Médium formuje naše myšlení, a proto <em>Medium is the message</em>.</p>\n<p>To je diktum vysloveném teoretikem médií Marshallem McLuhanem, který tímto upozornil na fakt, že i když jsme se doposud v analýze médií věnovali především obsahu, nastal čase obrátit pozornost i směrem k té části technického aparátu, který obsah zprostředkovává &#8211; mediuje. Podle McLuhana je “[p]oselstvím každého média nebo technologie [&#8230;] změna měřítka, tempa nebo modelu, které zavádí do lidských záležitostí” [MCLUHAN, 1991, s. 20]. Každá technologie do lidského svět vnáší svou určitou logiku, kterou, pokud se jí poddáme, se naše společnost strukturuje. Jeden z důvodů, proč k tomu dochází je fakt, že technologie nám tyto možnosti nabízí &#8211; poskytují afordance a my se jich chytáme. Technologie nás svádí. Mají nad námi moc. Pokud někdo tvrdí, že technologie vládne světem, pak jsou to designéři, kteří tahají za provázky ze zákulisí. Do jisté míry, protože designéři opět reagují na požadavky společnosti a již existující kulturní a společenské zvyky, metafory a potřeby. Vztah mezi technologií a společností by mohlo být vyznačen jako vztah zpětné vazby. Jeden ovlivňuje druhého.</p>\n<p>Což je v přímém rozporu s tezí technologického determinismu, která tvrdí, že se technologie vyvíjí nezávisle na kultuře a společenském kontextu, ve kterém vzniká. Tuto tezi je třeba po fenomenologické analýze a kritice kognitivismu odmítnout. Svět, tělo a mysl tvoří jednotu, kde lidské zážitky a významy nejsou abstraktními, samostatně existujícími entitami, jež člověk nachází nezávisle na světě, nebo které designér může navrhnout bez zohlednění sociálního a kulturního kontextu. Člověk je vržen do světa, ve kterém jedná a významy a následně zážitky se nám ve světě odkrývají v závislosti na našich cílech a akcích, které konáme a které nám svět nabízí (“afffords”). Distribuovaná kognice navíc argumentuje, že technologické artefakty hrajou aktivní roli v ustanovení některých důležitých kognitivních procesů.</p>\n<p>Technologie rozšiřuje lidské schopnosti a vnáší do světa nové afordance. Generuje nové významy a zpětně redefinuje významy staré. Historie interakce s technologií je postupnou expanzí rozsahu lidských dovedností a schopností [DOURISH, 2014, s. 17] Protože technologie je vytvářena lidmi, můžeme, ba dokonce musíme se ptát, jaké afordance a významy v našich životech chceme. To již není technická otázka, ani otázka povrchu technických artefaktů, jak stále ještě dnes někteří vnímají design jako dekoratéra skoro hotových objektů. Je to filosofická otázka, která je i v jádru UX designu: zážitky se odvíjí od určité podoby světa. Jaký ten svět má být je otázkou přesahující, leč zahrnující design. Na vypořádání se s touto otázkou nestačí číst UX StackExchange online fórum a následovat zažité praktiky. Odpověď na to, jakým způsobem vytvářet technologii tak, aby poskytovala afordance, jež budou mít pozitivní dopad na společnosti, bude odpověď nová, neustále se fluidně proměňující a normativní, a proto také bude spadat do etiky. Technologie jako médium, které mění člověka a společnost, je filosofický problém. HCI akademici a UX designéři musí čerpat z takových teorií, které překonávají nedostatky kognitivismu, osvětlují vliv kontextu a zahrnují aktivní roli technologie v našich životech. Mezi takové kandidátní teorie považuji ty, jež nacházíme pod souhrnným označením postkognitivních teorií HCI. Relevantní analýzy, především mediační role technologických artefaktů, lze nalézt v současném výzkumu postfenomenologické větve filosofie techniky. Poslední část tohoto textu se bude právě věnovat krátkému představení jejich nejpodstatnějších myšlenek.</p>\n<h2>Druhá vlna HCI: nástup postkognitivismu a filosofie techniky</h2>\n<p>Hlavní intelektuální základu druhé vlny HCI tvoří tzv. postkognitivistické teorie. Toto označení získávají tím, že se jednoznačně vymezují vůči nedostatkům kognitivistických teorií. Kromě jejich kritiky ale přináší mnoho inovativních přístupů, jak skutečně produktivně překonat kognitivismus. Cílem této poslední sekce je ukázat, že premisy postkognitivistických teorií nabízí plodnou půdu, na jejíž základě lze „re-designovat“ obory zabývající se tvorbou i teoretickým zkoumáním interakce člověka s počítačovými systémy.</p>\n<p>Mezi postkognitivní teorie lze zařadit Activity teorii postavené na základě nedokončeného díla sovětského psychologa Lva Vygotského, Actor-network teorii vypracovanou francouzským sociologem Bruno Latourem, fenomenologii a zmiňovanou teorii distribuované, vtělené a rozšířené mysli, jež především příspěvkem akademika Paula Dourishe lze v kontextu HCI číst jako vtělenou interakci (embodied interaction).</p>\n<p>Budu vycházet především z knihy Acting with technology: Activity theory and Interaction design, která nabízí nízkoprahovou vstupní bránu do studia postkognitivistických teorií HCI a interakčního designu. Autoři této knihy poskytují shrnutí a srovnání jednotlivých teorií. Právě při srovnání vychází najevo, že i když postkognitivistické teorie sdílí mnoho společného, přeci jen obsahují důležité rozdíly, které je potřeba zmínit. Mezi nejzásadnější rozdíly patří odlišný pohled na roli subjektu a jeho agenci, kde activity teorie a fenomenologie přisuzují určité privilegované vlastnosti lidskému subjektu, kdežto distribuovaná kognice a actor-network teorie umisťují lidský subjekt do rozsáhlé propojené sítě živých a neživých entit, respektive „uzlů“, které považuje za symetricky rovnocenné.</p>\n<p>V tomto textu se primárně zaměřím na představení activity teorie a současného postfenomenologického výzkumu ve filosofii techniky. Pro ostatní teorie zmíním jejich nejdůležitějších charakteristiky.</p>\n<h3>Představení jednotlivých teorií</h3>\n<p>Přes své rozdíly všechny představované teorie se shodují na tom, že technologie ovlivňuje významnou část našich životů. Dále odmítají dualistické pojetí těla a mysli, když tvrdí, že individuum není definováno hranicemi svého těla. Různými způsoby se snaží explikovat představu fundamentální jednoty mysli a světa [KAPTELININ a NARDI, 2006, s. 197] Neméně důležité je zmínit, že vymezení vůči kognitivismu také spočítá v tom, že kognitivismus velmi zřídka chápal technologii jako něco, co je hodno podrobné analýzy ve vztahu k lidské kognici. Postkognitivistické teorie a postfenomenologie analyzují technologii nejen jako extenzi lidských smyslů po vzoru McLuhana, ale též jako médium cílově a objektově orientované aktivity, kterou technologie zprostředkovává netriviálním způsobem interakci se světem. Jak již bylo dříve řečeno, všechny teorie se shodují v tezi, že technologie aktivně participuje na konstituci našeho vztahu ke světu.</p>\n<p>Tím technologie a její použití promlouvá do toho, jak poznáváme svět, jaké věcí pro nás existují a co představuje dobrý život, který bychom měli vést, tedy tradičních epistemologických, ontologických a etických otázek filosofie.</p>\n<h3>Activity teorie</h3>\n<p>Activity teorie vychází z díla geniálního sovětského psychologa Lva Vygotskyho, který za svou krátkou, ale produktivní kariéru se zasloužil o revoluční myšlenky v pedagogické psychologii. Přestože Vygotsky publikoval od třicátých let, teprve v roce 1960 byla poprvé do anglického jazyka přeložena nějaká jeho kniha, konkrétně <em>Thought and Language</em>. Mezi důvody, proč se Vygotskyho dílo nedostalo mimo hranice Sovětského svazu dříve, byla jednak sporadická publikace jeho díla a také skutečnost, že Vygotskyho teorie byly po jeho smrti až do roku 1956 zakázané. [YAROSHEVSKY, 1989]</p>\n<p>Activity teorie je socio-kulturní teorií vývoje lidské mysli. Tezí této teorie je, že lidská mysl se konstruuje prostřednictvím interakce se světem, což znamená, že spíše než atributem člověka lze mysl chápat jako atribut vztahu mezi objektem a subjektem. Vědomí je v activity teorii viděno jako výsledek praktické aktivity v rámci dynamického vztahu mezi interní kognicí a externím světem artefaktů a lidí. [KAPTELININ a NARDI, 2006, s. 197]. Proto je jejím klíčovým principem tzv. mediace pomocí nástrojů, kde nejen technologické nástroje pomáhají sociálně kontextualizovanému subjektu s vývojem i vzděláním. Je třeba připomenout, že Vygotsky se především zajímal o psychologický vývoj lidí při vzdělávání.</p>\n<p>V pedagogické psychologii postuloval dva významné zákony. První z nich, The Zone of Proximal development, definuje potenciál toho, co se člověk dokáže naučit, pokud je mu poskytnuta pomoc ze strany učitele-mentora. Druhý univerzální zákon psychologického vývoje říká, že nové psychologické funkce jsou nejdříve distribuovány mezi lidmi nebo nástroji a se zvýšenou kompetencí a zkušenostmi je externí pomoc nahrazena internalizací, po které se subjekt v daných aktivitách obejde bez cizí pomoci [KAPTELININ a NARDI, 2006, s. 204]. Activity teorie podobně jako distribuovaná kognice tak obsahují koncept mediace pomocí nástrojů (tool mediation), díky které lidské subjekty jsou schopni rozšířit své kognitivní dovednosti a kompetence.</p>\n<p>Mediace pomocí nástrojů je pro activity teorii klíčový prvek. Ve vztahu k HCI, interakčnímu designu a UX navrhuje activity teorie, aby design technologie byl založen na analýze toho, jakou má technologie roli v aktivitách, které s ní vykonáváme. Design technologií by se tím pádem měl zajímat o morální a etické problémy, kulturní diverzitu, sociální implikace, emoce, pocity či spiritualitu, které technologie zprostředkovává [KAPTELININ a NARDI, 2006, s. 27].</p>\n<p>Ve srovnání s první, kognitivistickou vlnou HCI se activity teorie zajímá o sociální kontext, ve kterých aktivity probíhají a význam těchto aktivit. Explicitně tedy activity teorie odmítá, že lze studovat interakce člověk-stroj v laboratorních podmínkách, zcela oproštěných od reálného kontextu aktivit.</p>\n<p>První, kdo upozornil na využití activity teorie v HCI, byla dánská akademička informatiky Susanne Bødkerová, která byla klíčovou postavou komunity participativního designu. V letech 1982-1983 si během svého akademického působení ve společnosti Xerox PARC i na základě svých zkušeností s participativním designu uvědomila limity tehdy dominantního informačně-kognitivního přístupu k HCI. O sedm let později předložila svou doktorskou dizertační práci, ve které argumentovala, že activity teorie by mohla být vhodným základem pro HCI výzkum a design, neboť poskytuje metody, jak analyzovat lidské použití technologie v širším kontextu interakce se světem: interakce mediované technologií. [KAPTELININ a NARDI, 2006, s. 73].</p>\n<h3>Fenomenologie a vtělená interakce</h3>\n<p>Paul Dourish ve své knize <em>Where the Action Is </em>propojuje hluboce intelektuální analýzu filosofických proudů fenomenologie s teoretickými přístupy v oboru HCI. Dourish se zaměřuje na dva nové proudy v návrhu interakcí: <em>tangible computing</em> a <em>social computing</em>. Tangible computing (uchopitelná, hmatatelná komputace), respektive tangible user interface je přístup k návrhu uživatelského rozhraní, které zdůrazňuje možnost fyzické a prostorové interakce s interaktivními objekty tak, aby s digitální a datovou vrstvu objektů mohl uživatel interagovat a manipulovat. Social computing (sociální komputace) je pak přístup, který zdůrazňuje, že interakce s technologiemi je svázána s kontextem, ve kterém tato interakce probíhá. Proto, jak Dourish poukazuje, je vhodné čerpat z tradičních sociologických, antropologických a etnografických metod pro získání informací o tom, jak uživatelé reálně technologii používají. Dourish, zdůrazňuje, že sociální akce není abstrakcí, ale sociálně zakotvenou [DOURISH, 2004, s. 96].</p>\n<p>Na základě analýzy těchto dvou přístupů ke komputaci pokračuje Dourish analýzou fenomenologických myšlenek, pomocí kterých poukazuje na to, co již argumentoval Heidegger, tedy že člověk je situován ve fyzickém, pre-organizovaném světě různých nároků a možností , kde lidská mysl je vtělena ve fyzickém těle, stejně tak jako tělo je zakotveno ve fyzickém světě [PEPPERELL, 2013]. Dourishův vlastní termín “vtělené interakce” (embodied interaction) navazuje na fenomenologickou analýzu a definuje ho jako “tvorbu, manipulaci a sdílení významů skrze [&#8230;] interakci s artefakty” [DOURISH, 2004, s. 126]. Dourish reflektuje mnou dříve provedenou analýzu nedostatků první vlny HCI a kognitivismu, včetně situovanosti a vtělenosti kognice, když píše, že “[n]aše akce nemohou být odděleny od významů, který jim a ostatní připisujeme.”  [DOURISH, 2004, s. 189]. Dourish se tedy zajímá o již několikrát zmíněný problém pro HCI a design obecně: jak zkoumat akce, aktivity a praktickou činnost v sociálním kontextu tak, aby designéři byli schopni této znalosti využít pro návrh technologií, které jsou funkční, přívětivější, esteticky zajímavější a také poskytující smysluplné zážitky. Jeho diskuze sociologických a etnografických metod pro využití v HCI a UX designu je tak konkrétním příkladem, jak zkoumat širší socio-kulturní kontext, ve kterém lidé používají technologii.</p>\n<h3>Actor-network teorie a distribuovaná kognice v HCI</h3>\n<p>Actor-network teorie i distribuovaná kognice podobně jako ostatní postkognitivistické přístupy odmítají dichotomii subjektu-objektu. ANT ji řeší tak, že navrhují lidský subjekt vložit do heterogenních sítí, ve kterých se dále objevují artefakty, organizace, ale také nemateriální objekty. Všechny součásti takových sítí jsou nazývány <em>actory</em> (činiteli, aktory, agenty apod.), kteří mezi sebou interagují. ANT je svou povahou relační a poststrukturalistickou teorií, neboť přisuzuje zásadní váhu vztahům mezi jednotlivými uzly sítím. Agence je lidem i neživým objektům přiřažena na základě vztahů, které mají s dalšími uzly sítě.</p>\n<p>Distribuovaná kognice je známým přístupem v oboru HCI, který podobně jako activity teorie zdůrazňuje důležitost nástrojů a technologických artefaktů pro lidskou kognici [KAPTELININ a NARDI, 2006, s. 195]. Pro porovnání s ostatními postkognitivistickými přístupy je důležité, že lidé a nástroje jsou podle distribuované kognice v kognitivním systému definovány jako ekvivalentní média. [KAPTELININ a NARDI, 2006, s. 195]</p>\n<p>Zatímco activity teorie, fenomenologie a postfenomenologie přisuzují agenci a intencionalitu pouze člověku, ANT a distribuovaná kognice chápou člověka jako ekvivalentní “uzel” sítě živých i neživých, materiálních a nemateriálních aktérů, čímž ustanovují vztahy mezi uzly sítě jako symetrické. Veerbek komentuje, že ANT svou radikální symetrií aktérů ztrácí možnost vysvětlit prožívání lidských akterů, včetně toho, jak technologické artefakty pro lidské aktéry unikátně mediují svět. [VEERBEK, 2015]</p>\n<h3>Postfenomenologie</h3>\n<p>Ve filosofii techniky nacházíme v současné době aktivní výzkum v tzv. mediační teorie technologie, kterou se zabývá Peter-Paul Veerbek. Mediační teorie analyzuje a vysvětluje různé typy vztahů a interakcí člověka s technologií. Veerbekův výzkum se zároveň zabývá etickými otázkami technologie, kterými chce Veerbek přispět k diskuzi o tom, jak technologie může zlepšit životy lidí. Je to posun od dřívějšího zaměření filosofie techniky, která veskrze viděla techniku jako negativní element. Technika byla analyzována na pozadí dialektického pohledu, kdy technika je něco, s čím se člověk musí vypořádat, co musí překonat, čemu se musí bránit, aby kompletně člověk nepřišel o zbytek svého lidství. Veerbek ale nepřímo navazuje na McLuhanův “program” studia mediačních efektů technologií. Zároveň ale jeho mediační teorie jde dále: nejen, že studuje mediační roli technologií z jejich technického hlediska, zároveň zkoumá, jak lidé tyto technologické mediace apropriují, což je téma stále z velké části neprozkoumané [VEERBEK, 2015]. Veerbekova práce zapadá do širšího filosofického proudu filosofie techniky postfenomenologie. Mezi další výrazné autory tohoto směru se řadí americký filosof Don Ihde, z jehož příspěvku podrobné analýzy typu interakcí člověk-technologie Veerbek vychází.</p>\n<p>V první řadě postfenomenologie také odmítá modernistický rozštěp subjekt-objektové dichotomie, ale narozdíl od ANT a distribuované kognice nesouhlasí s tím, že by se měl lidský aktér analyzovat na stejné úrovni jako technologické či nemateriální objekty.</p>\n<p>Mediační teorie ovšem nevidí člověka a technologii ani jako opačné a fixní póly, mezi kterými probíhá interakce, ale jako výsledek této interakce. [VERBEEK, 2015a] Mediační teorie redefinuje interakční design. Místo “interakce” jakožto hlavní jednotky, která se má designovat, navrhuje, aby si interakční designéři uvědomili, že nenavrhují interakce s technologií, ale vztah člověka ke světu samotnému, ke kterému přistupujeme prostřednictvím technologie. To je již známá nota, kterou jsme v tomto textu slyšeli několikrát. Technologie jako médium, jako zprostředkovatel. Veerbek dodává:</p>\n<p>“Design interakcí [&#8230;] implikuje nejen design technologických objektů, které umožňují specifické interakce, ale také design lidských subjektů, které s těmito objekty interagují.. Designování technologie znamená designovat lidské bytosti.” [VERBEEK, 2015a]</p>\n<p>Postfenonemologie a mediační teorie jsou kritické vůči tomu vidět vztah člověk-technologie jen z pohledu funkcionality a použitelnosti, čímž komentují nedostatečnost první vlny oboru HCI, která se právě na tyto dva aspekty interakcí primárně zaměřovala. Veerbek píše, že ve věku chytrých mobilních technologiích, ambientní technologie, různých implantátů a technologických protéz užívaných ve zdravotnictví jsou funkčnost a použitelnost limitují nástroje, jak analyzovat technologii. Máme-li v mozku implantát, používáme-li plně automatizovaný chytrý dům, nejsou striktně řečeno používány. Naopak jsou navrženy tak, aby se s nimi člověk dostal do styku co nejméně. Postfenomenologie tak tvrdí, že je třeba podrobněji problematizovat, jak jinak je možné vidět vztah člověk-technologie. Veerbek vyjmenovává tři přístupy: <em>extenze</em>, <em>dialektika</em> a <em>hybridita</em>. [VERBEEK, 2015a]</p>\n<p>V případě prvního přístupu <em>extenze</em> technologii vnímáme primárně jako nástroje, kde nás zajímá především její instrumentální hodnota při vyplňování našich cílů a potřeb. Technologie se zdá být neutrální v tom smyslu, že se aktivně nepodílí na formování našich cílů a potřeb, pouze je pasivně pomáhá naplňovat.</p>\n<p><em>Dialektický</em> přístup zdůrazňuje technologii jako sílu, která na člověk působí jako negativní prvek způsobující pocit odcizení. Příkladem jako marxistická kritika mechanizace [VERBEEK, 2015a] nebo současná debata o vlivu automatizace a umělé inteligence, které urychlují tzv. technologickou nezaměstnanost, kdy technologie více a více nahrazují nízkokvalifikované pracovníky. Veerbek zmiňuje práci Ernsta Kappa a Wilhelma Schmida, kteří dialektický vztah k technologii chápali jako postupné osvobozování se za pomoci externalizace určitých lidských dovedností. Kappův filosoficko-antropologický přístup k technologii již v roce 1877 viděl technologii jako projekci lidských orgánů. [VERBEEK, 2015a]</p>\n<p><em>Hybridita</em> je přístup, který upozorňuje na dualistické subjekto-objektové tendence předchozích přístupů. Místo protipólů člověk/subjekt a technologie/objekt navrhuje tento přístup koncept hybridu, kdy člověk a technologie jsou vzájemně se ovlivňující síly, které formují jedna druhou. Zároveň hybridní přístup explicitně deklaruje technologii jako aktivně formující naše chování a interakci se světem, jaké <em>médium</em>, které nás spojuje se světem.</p>\n<p>Veerbek dále cituje práci amerického filosofa Dona Ihdeho a jeho podrobnější rozpracování vztahu člověk-technologie. Ihde pojmenovává následující vztahy: vtělený, hermeneutický, alteritní, na pozadí. Veerbek doplňuje Ihdeho analýzu svými vztahy <em>kyborga</em>, <em>imerze </em>a <em>augmentace</em>. Stručná popis jednotlivých vztahů je možno nalézt ve článku <em>A short introduction for mediation theory</em> napsaného právě Veerbekem.</p>\n<p>Veerbeka ale v první řadě zajímají etické problémy technologie. Stejně jako zmíněné postkognitivistické teorie HCI i postfenomenologická mediační teorie souhlasí, že technologie hraje aktivní roli při formování našich životů, a proto designéři nabývají zodpovědnosti za to, jaké <em>afordance</em> do technologií navrhnou. Jak jsem ale zmínil v jiné části textu, afordance jsou relativním vztahem mezi člověkem a jeho prostředím. Stejně jako zážitky, tak ani afordance nemá designér plně pod svou kontrolou. To ale neznamená, že rigorózní analýza a reflexe designérské činnosti není třeba. Naopak, Veerbek argumentuje, že právě nyní filosofie techniky zažívá renesanci, neboť je pro návrh technologií potřeba určitý teoretický rámec, který by designérům poskytl pevnou zem, od které se ve své kreativní činnosti mohou odrazit. Postfenomenologická filosofie techniky se právě o toto snaží.</p>\n<h2>Závěr</h2>\n<p>V tomto textu jsem se pokusil naznačit důležité aspekty současného myšlení o designu technologií. Zaprvé jsem se snažil problematizovat a ukázat, že původní premisy první vlny HCI založené na kognitivistickém a informačně-zpracovávajícím modelu lidské kognice, ignorovaly socio-kulturní kontext, ve kterém naše kognice probíhá. Dále jsem analýzou kritiky kognitivismu poukázal na alternativní, postkognitiviské teorie, které se snaží situovat člověka a jeho tělo do širšího kontextu, kde akce, aktivita a význam se odvíjí od praktické, každodenní činnosti a “interakce se světem. Mezi postkognitivistické teorie patří fenomenologie Martina Heideggera a jeho nástupců, activity teorie, actor-network teorie a distribuovaná kognice. K těmto teoriím jsem představil relevantní proud postfenomenologického výzkumu ve filosofii techniky.</p>\n<p>Zmíněné teorie a přístupy by měly poskytnout teoretické jádro tzv. druhé vlny HCI, interakčního a UX designu. Tyto oboru musí reagovat na to, že design technologií se nyní stává činností, jež zásadně ovlivňuje lidské životy z důvodu, na kterém se shodují všechny postkognitivistické teorie i postfenomenologie: technologie je médium, které aktivně formuje náš vztah ke světu. Designéři třímají ve svých rukou moc, ale zároveň i enormní potenciál, jak zlepšit současný svět. Bez teoretické základy se ale tato moc může zvrhnout buď v nevyužitý potenciál nebo v horším případě v dystopický scénář, kdy technologie se nám vymknou z rukou, neboť jsme až příliš dlouho nechali designéry si “hrát” bez toho, aniž by jejich práce byla kriticky a teoreticko-filosoficky zkoumána.</p>\n<p>Tento text se ve vším skromnosti kladl za cíl představit témata, která by neměla v teoreticko-filosofickém zkoumání vlivů technologie chybět. Podrobná analýzy postkognitivistických teorií, především actor-network teorie, byla nad rámec tohoto textu. I z tohoto důvodu se chystám tyto nedostatky napravit ve své diplomové práci.</p>\n<h2>Zdroje</h2>\n<p>BATTARBEE, KATJA a ILPO KOSKINEN. Co-experience: user experience as interaction.

Člověk může přečíst mnoho teorie, ale některé věci si musí zažít. Osobně jsem nyní přikloněn k názoru, že UX design je mnohem více o komunikaci, argumentaci a &#8222;překládání&#8220; terminologie, slovníku a myšlenek mezi IT, analýzou a business analýzou, než o práci s nějakým UX prototypovacím nástrojem. Neznamená to, že prototypování GUI není důležitým výsledným produktem práce UXáka, ale je jen pomyslnou špičkou ledovce. Špatně pochopená analýza a business požadavky vždycky povedou ke špatnému UX, přestože člověk může být jakkoli v prototypování talentovaný. I proto si myslím, že se v praxi ukazuje má domněnka, že UXák kognitivně stojí na pekuliární pozici mezi kreativitou a analýzou, mezi chaosem a řádem, a musí velmi dobře ovládat obě formy uvažování. Což je jeden z bodů mého &#8222;empirického&#8220; desatera.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ideálně vše, na čem pracuješ, vykazuj.</li>\n<li>Předtím, než cokoli navrhneš, ujisti se, že dobře rozumíš a znáš business a analytickou dokumentaci.</li>\n<li>Nauč se terminologii businessu, analýzy a vývoje, abys byl schopný komunikovat své UX nápady jejich přirozeným jazykem.</li>\n<li>Jelikož budeš komunikovat s businessem, analýzou a vývojem, připrav se na to, že si budeš muset zapisovat jejich nápady a připomínky. Nejen abys měl jistotu, že si věci pamatuješ, ale také, abys měl argumenty proto, proč jsi navrhl v UX věci daným způsobem.</li>\n<li>Pracuješ s talentovanými a inteligentními lidmi. Přesto každý nemá tvůj talent si v hlavě představit uživatelské rozhraní, animace, interakce apod. Proto se snaž komunikovat své nápady konkrétním jazykem bez zbytečných abstrakcí. Stále platí, že obraz, nebo lépe prototyp se rovná 1000 slov.</li>\n<li>Připravuj se na schůze. Utvoř si osnovu toho, co chceš probrat. Ujisti se, že daná místnost má projektor, potřebné vybavení, kabely apod.</li>\n<li>Neboj se využívat volné zasedací místnosti pro kreslení na tabule a rychlé prototypování. Je dobré občas opustit prostředí softwaru a vzít do ruky tužku nebo fix. Podpoří to tvou kreativitu.</li>\n<li>V Axure či jiném prototypovacím nástroji používej monochromatické barevné schéma.

Cicero / Stanford News Service</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Klíčová slova: McLuhan, Flusser, kognitivní schopnosti, Gutenbergova galaxie, virtuální realita, vizuální myšlení</p>\n<h2>Úvod</h2>\n<p>Motivací pro následující esej byla otázka položená během semináře Informační politiky. Při dotazu, jak bude vypadat informační společnost za několik let, jsem vyslovil tezi, že společnosti bude dominovat virtuální realita a s tím spojený nový druh myšlení. V průběhu semestru jsem na tuto otázku jednu kratší práci již napsal. Tento text je rozvedení spekulace nad touto otázkou.</p>\n<h2>Text</h2>\n<p>Jedna z podkapitol, které se informační politika věnuje, je informační společnost. Ve svém jádru se tento ne příliš stabilní koncept snaží ve skutečnosti o artikulaci něčeho intuitivně zřejmého, tedy že technologie je nezanedbatelný prvek lidského života. Člověk a technologie se vzájemně ovlivňují. Je to druh vztahu, pro jehož popis si rád vypůjčuji terminologii zavedenou oborem kybernetiky, jmenovitě pojmy “zpětné vazby” nebo “zpětné smyčky”, které mi slouží jako vizuální pomůcka k pochopení veskrze abstraktního symbiotického vztahu mezi člověkem a technologií. Abstrakce je nutností, přestože (nebo možná právě proto) každý z nás si dokáže představit hmatatelné příklady i osobní příhody toho, jak je jeho život moderní technologií ovlivňován.</p>\n<p>Intuitivní uchopení problému není špatně, ale jako se nespokojíme s vysoce komprimovaným obrázkem ve formátu jpg, tak i v tomto případě při bližším zkoumání něco chybí. Tím chybějícím, jež musí doplňovat naší intuici, je existující a rozsáhlá literatura zabývající se konceptem informační společnosti. Ta nabízí mnoho témat a debat zkoumajících, zdali vliv informací v současné moderní společnosti je něčím výrazně novým, nebo hrály svou úlohu již od nepaměti, případně jak technologie mění od základů struktury našeho myšlení a představu, co znamená být člověkem, jak vidíme v trans- a post-humanistických přístupech k tradičním problémům humanitních věd.</p>\n<p>Analýza informační společnosti nevynechává otázky, které se týkající probíhajících změn pracovního trhu a příležitostí. Zkoumání změn pracovního trhu jako odpovědi na nové technologie se vyskytuje v mnoha dílech teoretiků informační společnosti a osobně tuto část analýzy informační společnosti považuji za zajímavou styčnou plochu, kde se setkávají ekonomická, sociologická, a dokonce i kognitivně-psychologická témata.</p>\n<p>Ať už si totiž přejeme nebo ne, současný ekonomický systém většiny západní společnosti, kombinující prvky volného trhu a státní regulace, je založen na schopnosti neustále inovovat a ti, kteří toho jsou schopni, získávají finanční ohodnocení a s tím související sociální status. Řekl bych, že mnoho analýz teoretiků informační společnosti v tomto bodě končí. Já se chci ale ptát dále. Máme-li definované soubory hodnot, které jsou ve společensko-ekonomickém systému akcentovány, jací lidé naplňují požadavky na tvůrce těchto hodnot, jinak řečeno, co konkrétně tito lidé umí, znají, a jak se liší jejich kognitivní aparát, že jsou schopni v daném kontextu vyčnívat nad ostatními?</p>\n<p>Volba kognice jako vlivného faktoru je opodstatněná, neboť čím dál tím více se ukazuje, že kognitivní schopnosti, inteligence a kreativita jsou důležité faktory ekonomického úspěchu jedinců, komerčních firem, a nakonec i celé společnosti, jestliže společnost vnímáme jako součet jedinců, kteří v ní participují. Termíny jako “creative industries”, “creative economy” nebo “kognitivní kapitalismus”, jež popisují schopnosti oceňované trhem, na teoretické rovině jednoznačně staví na konceptu informační společnosti, neboť ve všech případech podle nich tyto typy současných ekonomik nejen že umocňují důležitost informací, ale zároveň specifikují, že především generování nových a užitečných informací (což je zhruba definice kreativity) je pomyslným hnacím motorem ekonomického růstu.</p>\n<p>Co se ale přesně s příchodem informačních technologií změnilo, že najednou inteligence a kreativita mají takovou hodnotu? Jelikož tyto vlastnosti byly více méně vždy přítomny v lidech, včetně jejich nerovnoměrné distribuce, co přesně je na informačních technologiích a společnosti na nich postavené jiné, že zmíněné vlastnosti jsou tak oceňované? Anebo se lze ptát obecněji: co přesně technologie v určitém revolučním období obsahuje, jak je tvořena, že dala vzniknout poptávce po určitých dovednostech a schopnostech? A byly tyto schopnosti vždy přítomny, třebaže jen latentně čekaly na svůj pravý čas, nebo emergence technologie dala vzniknout skutečně novému „vědomí člověka“, jak popisuje Marshall McLuhan ve své knize Gutenberg Galaxy komentující vliv médií na člověka?</p>\n<p>McLuhan v knize píše, že teorie kulturních změn se musí opírat o znalosti toho, jak technologické změny mění poměr využívání a důležitosti jednotlivých lidských smyslových orgánů. McLuhan se své teze chopí a analyzuje období evropské civilizace před a po zavedení Gutenbergova tiskařského lisu. Zatímco před jeho uvedením byla společnost predominantně zaměřená na tu část reality, kterou lze vnímat a přenášet orálně, sluchově a hmatově, tiskařský lis a rozmach čteného slova přivedly společnost do nového, vizuálního módu vnímání světa. McLuhan může tak tvrdit, neboť tištěné slovo jako médium přenosu informací bylo nutné vidět. McLuhanův argument je samozřejmě komplexnější, zvláště jeho popis toho, jak lidské vědomí předtiskové období společnosti bylo zahaleno do jednotného, holistického celku, který byl s příchodem tisku a tištěného slova rozparcován do částí, neboť tištěné slovo, kniha a čtení pro sebe jsou velmi individualistické aktivity, jež podle McLuhana vedly (mimo jiné) k vzrůstu individualismu a nacionalismu (<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">MCLUHAN, </span>157-158) a také poptávce po více mechanickému a kvantitativnímu myšlení a uchopení logiky a dialektiky (<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">MCLUHAN, </span>159). McLuhana teze, kterou není jednoduché identifikovat, jelikož se “rozplývá” ve fragmentech napříč jeho celou knihou, tkví v ukázání, že technologie a technologické revoluce jsou jednou z nejdůležitějších příčin průmyslových revolucí, které navíc způsobují netriviální kognitivní změny v lidském vědomí a zvýšené sensibilitě, nebo naopak znecitlivění některých z pěti lidských smyslových orgánů. Předtisková doba byla pro McLuhana dobou využívající orální přenos informací a sluchový orgán, kdežto knihtisk nás přetvořil na „gutenbergovského člověka&#8220;, jehož předchozí zkušenost mnohosti smyslů je homogenizována a redukována na jeden jediný, jakýsi diktát vizuálního vnímání a myšlení (<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">MCLUHAN, </span>125). Protilékem proti tomuto pro McLuhana negativnímu trendu byla, v době před internetem, elektrifikace, jež z individualistické společnosti měla nově dostupnou mediální interkonektivitou znovu udělat společnost “globální vesnicí”, neboť “elektrický věk není mechanický, ale organický a chová málo sympatií vůči hodnotám dosažených prostřednictvím typografie, ‘mechanického způsobu psaní’ [&#8230;]” (<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">MCLUHAN, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 11pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\">135).</span></p>\n<p>Přestože je třeba opatrnost před přílišným zjednodušujícím pohledem na McLuhanovu asociaci revoluce tisku a čtení jako primárně spojených s vizuální kognicí, i po detailnějším prozkoumání knihy mi McLuhanovy teze přijde problematická. Přeskočím-li skutečně triviální tvrzení, že náš zrak musí fungovat, abychom viděli text, který máme číst, narazím na to, že člověk musí dále vykázat znalost jazyka, včetně schopnosti tuto znalost použít pro dekódování lingvistických znaků, jejích významů i pochopení širšího pragmatického kontextu. To jsou pro čtení násobně důležitější úkony než vizuální percepce materiálu, na kterém jsou natištěné nějaké znaky. Tak totiž text vnímá negramotný člověk, který se jako “čtenář” znatelně liší od člověka gramotného. Gramotnost a schopnost manipulace s lingvistickým obsahem jsou primární dovednosti člověka-čtenáře. Jako extrémní, i když validní protipříklad k McLuhanovy lze zmínit osoby, které pro čtení nemohou využívat svůj zrak, tak jak je to v případě zrakově postižených, ale gramotných ve čtení braillova písma. McLuhan přikládá knihtisku, text, “Typografickému nebo Gutenbergovu” člověku nové a přelomové vlastnosti, jež transformovaly evropskou společnost. Skutečně by ale tyto vlastnosti nabyl negramotný člověk, který by vizuálně očima pouze přejížděl řádek po řádku text, jenž by pro něj byl jen shlukem nesrozumitelných a obsahově vyprázdněných znaků?</p>\n<p>Takto gramotnost a text určitě revoluci nezpůsobily, čímž lpění na vizualitě čtení jako hlavního prostředku zpracování lingvistických znaků se najednou jeví jako velké nedorozumění. Jakoby McLuhan správně identifikoval symptomy gramotné, gutenbergovské společnosti, tedy onu výše zmíněnou mechanizaci a kvantifikaci myšlení (a tím i vývoj logického myšlení), ale prohodil příčiny. Vizualita a vizuální percepce jsou i do dnešní doby tak obtížně algoritmizovatelné právě proto, že na našich běžných, makroskopických úrovních nevidíme svět v diskrétních jednotkách, ale jako holistický celek. Že svět kolem nás není na makroskopické úrovni diskrétní, ale holistický, byl také problém postavený před matematiku a fyziku 17. a 18. století. Vyřešen byl částečně karteziánskou analytickou geometrií, a konečně až s příchodem diferenciálního a integrálního počtu. Přibližně od druhé poloviny 20. století se ten samý problém uchopení vizuální percepce vyskytl v nově vzniklém oboru Umělé inteligence a později i kognitivní vědě. Výzkumníci těchto oborů se dodnes snaží naprogramovat stroj schopný vnímat vizuální prostor minimálně na takové úrovni, na jaké to zvládne člověk. Holismus vizuálna ale před vědce klade problém, na co se přesně při zpracování vstupních dat má software zaměřit, což implikuje určitou formu definování cílů a schopnosti porozumět významu toho, co se zpracovává. Teprve nedávno pokroky v počítačovém vidění využívající nové komputační metody strojového učení a neuronových sítí dosáhly znatelného pokroku “jen” v identifikaci objektů v prostoru. Skutečnému porozumění vizuální scény to ale nestačí. Počítačové vidění zde naráží na dominantní paradigma kognitivní vědy hlásající, že vizuální percepce a porozumění jejího obsahu stačí symbolická manipulace dat. Na limity tohoto přístupu odpovídá nové hnutí “embodiment cognition”, které pro realistickou tvorbu umělé inteligence rovnající se svými schopnosti člověku, bere v potaz myšlenku, že pro vnímání a porozumění je nutné zahrnout “tělesnost”, neboť jak se zdá, vědomí člověka je na tělesnosti závislé více, než se myslelo. Význam věcí kolem nás je vytvářen také tím, že jsme schopni si v hlavě představit, jinak řečeno simulovat, jaké by to bylo určité věci zažít.</p>\n<p>Jestliže McLuhan prohodil příčiny, co je po vynálezu tiskového lisu ta druhá a dle mého správnější příčina mechanizace a kvantifikace myšlení? Odpovědí je linearita. Konkrétně linearita a diskrétnost textu. Zatímco jazyk je pro negramotného člověka automatická a přirozená činnost, gramotný člověk dokáže jazyk problematizovat, neboť si je lépe vědom pravidel konstrukce jazyka, a tak má mnohem lepší předpoklad být schopen reflexe nad tím, jak jazyk formuje myšlení. Psaná forma jazyka k tomu napomáhá tím, že je možné v čase produkci jazyka zmrazit a podívat se na něj z ptačí perspektivy. Stejně tak psaní uživateli jazyka napomáhá s disciplínou konstrukce myšlenek, protože vyžaduje myslet sekvenčně, krok za krokem. Na kognitivní úrovni jednotlivce se tak skutečně dostáváme k závěru, že rozšíření gramotnosti a práce s psaným jazykem přispívá k mechanizaci myšlení, což jsou předpoklady i pro racionální myšlení jako takové, které se minimálně na Západě od osvícenství opírá o sekvenční, kauzální vyvozování logických závěrů. Na kognitivní úrovni lze s McLuhanem souhlasit. Rozšíření čtení psaného textu ukázňuje, mechanizuje mysl.</p>\n<p>Abychom ale na základě kognitivních strategií v myšlení mohli hovořit o celospolečenské revoluci, je nutné pochopit, jak se potenciálně užitečná technologie masověji rozšíří, aby vůbec měla tak dalekosáhlý účinek. K tomu poslouží biologická metafora přirozeného výběru. Zatímco všichni lidé se rodí s vrozenou schopností používat jazyk orálně, literární gramotnost je produktem kultury. Tak jako náhodné genetické mutace se v prostředí zachovávají a rozšiřují v závislosti na tom, jakou evoluční výhodu organismu poskytují, tak i kulturou vyvolané vzorce chování se mohou masivněji ve společnosti rozšířit jen tehdy, pokud lidem poskytují nějakou výhodu.</p>\n<p>“Na počátku dějin a v průběhu jejich podstatě delšího údobí zůstávala abeceda výsadou elity.” (FLUSSER, 71), píše Vilém Flusser v eseji Alfanumerická společnost mapující působení verbálních a matematických znaků ve společnosti. Gramotnost se před vynálezem tiskového lisu mohla jen velmi těžce rozšířit, protože ruční výroba knihy byla nákladná. Knihy byly luxusní zboží a jako volnočasovou zábavu si jejich pořízení mohla dovolit jen hrstka z celkové populace. Univerzitní systém knihy samozřejmě používal, ale veřejné školství se rozšířilo až v období osvícenství, takže vzdělání bylo opět určené pro úzké spektrum společnosti a většinou bylo organizované kolem praktických povolání nebo filosoficko-teologické výchovy. Většina lidí nepřemýšlela nad tím, jakou roli by knihy a gramotnost měly v jejich životech hrát.</p>\n<p>Knihtisk povědomí o důležitosti gramotnosti a vliv textu změnil. Demokratizace přístupu ke knihám znamenala, že více lidí si na základě vlastní zkušenosti dokázalo představit, k čemu knihy a gramotnost jsou nebo mohou být. To pokračovalo jako spirála. Stoupající gramotnost znamenala vyšší poptávku po různých žánrech. Kultivace soukromého a kritičtějšího čtení způsobila, že lidé začali rozeznávat rozdíly mezi autory jednotlivých knih. Prestiž schopnosti psát stoupala nepřímo úměrně prestiži čtení. Jinak řečeno, čím méně prestižní a více demokratické čtení bylo, tím více stoupala prestiž těch, kteří texty produkovali. Postupně vznikl koncept autorství. I proto, že lidé byli dostatečně zdatnými čtenáři, aby rozeznali schopnosti jednotlivých autorů. Společnost přešla nikoli na vizuální mód myšlení, jak tvrdí McLuhan, ale na mód verbální.</p>\n<p>Historie nabízí i další precedens, kdy technologický vývoj znatelně začal privilegovat určitý mód myšlení. Podobně si totiž můžeme připomenout počátek uvedení digitálního počítače na začátku druhé poloviny 20. století, kdy počítače byly velké, drahé a nedostupné. Používaly se pro specializované vědecké výpočty. Málokdo přemýšlel nad tím, jaké by to bylo, kdyby uměl programovat, a jaké výhody by mu to přineslo. Bylo nemyslitelné, aby širší veřejnost dokázala porovnat, zdali jeden program je robustněji napsán než druhý, případně zdali je jeden programátor lepší než druhý. To se změnilo po uvedení osobních počítačů a rozšíření internetu. Tyto technologické novinky zapůsobily stejně jako příchod knihtisku: demokratizovaly přístup k informačním technologiím, začlenily počítače hluboko do jádra společnosti, a tím také vytvořily základ proto, aby vyrostla nová poptávka po informačních odbornících, lidech, kteří dokáží myslet a komunikovat nikoli už jen v lingvistických kódech, jejichž hodnota, jak argumentuje Flusser ve své eseji, paradoxně klesá, ale v kódech matematických a algoritmických. Na rozdíl od gramotnosti a knihtisku není možné hovořit o tom, že by počítačová technologie byla před svým masovým rozšířením dostupná jen bohaté vrstvě, protože i lidé, kteří oplývali finančnímu prostředky, tedy lidé například ze sektoru byznysu, netušili, co si o těchto technologiích myslet. Známé jsou citace předních manažerů a vlastníků společnosti, mezi kterými lze najít takové památné ukázky jako prohlášení prezidenta IBM z roku 1943, že celosvětově existuje trh maximálně pro pět počítačů, případně pozdější citace z roku 1977, rok po uvedení prvního osobního počítače Apple, kdy Ken Olsen, spolumajitel tehdy významné počítačové společnosti Digital Equipment Corporation, vyslovil, že nevidí důvod, proč by někdo chtěl mít doma počítač (i když je možné, že cloudové řešení skutečně učiní vlastnění fyzického počítače zbytečným).</p>\n<p>Argumentace a posteriori není vůči těmto jinak významným odborníkům příliš férová, protože jak praví známé přísloví, po bitvě je každý generál. Já zde nezmiňuji tyto historické ukázky nepřesných odhadů pro zesměšnění, nýbrž jako hodnotné záznamy o tom, že když i přední odborníci své doby nedokázali předpovědět dopad informačních technologií pár let dopředu, jaká je pravděpodobnost, že toho byl schopný “běžný” občan?</p>\n<p>Analogicky ke knihtisku byl pro informační technologie zásadní nejen samotný technologický pokrok, ale také širší adaptace veřejností, která z této technologie učinila nezbytnou páteřní infrastrukturu moderní společnosti, a to do takové míry, že si dnes bez ní těžko dokážeme představit funkční život. Symbiotický vztah počítače a člověka ale vyžadoval nové přístupy k tvorbě informační technologie, což vyústilo ve vzniku nového oboru human-computer interaction (HCI), který začal seriózně studovat psychologické, kognitivní a později i sociální aspekty informačních technologií. Postupně se informační technologie proměnily z ryze ezoterického zájmu několika odborníků a samouků na nové, masové médium, u kterého sociokulturní aspekty jsou stejně důležité jako ty technické. Čím více informační technologie prorůstají společností, tím více je požadován nový “jazyk” přizpůsobený práci s touto technologií.</p>\n<p>Lingvistický kód je již neadekvátní, neboť se nejedná o dostatečně přesný a formalizovaný jazyk, který by vyhovoval práci s počítačem. Nový kód pro práci s počítačem vychází z predikátové a výrokové logiky. Spíše, než s konkrétními objekty, je třeba vždycky pracovat s abstrakcemi a zobecněním. Jak popisuje Flusser, dochází k matematizaci společnosti a to nejen proto, aby bylo možné s počítačem pracovat. Obor HCI určitým způsobem se snaží být opoziční silou vůči tomuto trendu, snaží se navrhovat prostředníka, interface, mezi člověkem a strojem, aby nebylo nutné se matematizaci poddat. Avšak práce s počítačem je jen malý kus této další revoluce. Ukazuje se, že matematizace světa funguje velmi dobře, zvláště pokud máme dostatečně výkonné systémy, které jsou schopné poskytovat do nedávna nemožné výpočetní výkony a datové kapacity. Algoritmy nejsou jen prostředkem, jak lidé komunikují s binární logikou stroje, jsou novým pohledem na svět: o softwaru a algoritmech hovoří kognitivní věda, když mluví o tom, jak funguje mozek; matematika a teoretická fyzika užívá fraktálů a jednotky bitu pro popsání toho, jak funguje svět. Počítačová kultura představuje metaforu dominující v této éře naší představivosti stejně jako kdysi mechanické hodinky v době Newtona nebo čtyři přírodní elementy v době antické.</p>\n<p>Je třeba upozornit na to, že matematizace nutně nevytlačuje kreativitu. Pouze jí diktuje, s jakým uměleckým materiálem může kreativec pracovat. Omezení ale byla součástí kreativity odjakživa: sochař si volil postavu a materiál, malíř si volil velikost rámů, hudební skladatel volil tóninu, tanečník emoci nebo příběh, básník se zas vědomě a cíleně omezoval, když si místo nekonečného množství způsobů, jak poskládat báseň, volil pevně definovaný žánr sonetu. Lze spekulovat, že kreativita bez omezení není možná.</p>\n<p>Proto matematizace kreativity a kreativní algoritmizace nejsou protimluvy, nýbrž reálné popisy toho, co nyní pohání ekonomický vývoj. Vznikají nová pracovní místa a nové obory, které požadují schopnost algoritmizovat řešení ke složitým problémům. Pro tyto obory není přirozený jazyk nutností. Naopak, jeho nepřesnosti jej činí neadekvátním nástrojem. Od verbálního myšlení se dostáváme k formálnímu, algoritmickému, matematickému myšlení.</p>\n<p>Tak jako před vynálezem knihtisku existovali lidé, kteří byli výjimečně nadáni pro čtení a psaní a obecně verbální dovednosti, a jejichž talent se mohl výrazněji projevit až tehdy, když nová technologická revoluce požadavek po tomto talentu masově rozšířila, tak i matematická dovednost a formální uvažování byly přítomny ve společnosti, avšak až s příchodem digitálních počítačů a jejich rozšířením do všech koutů společnosti se tyto dovedností staly vysoce vyhledávanými.</p>\n<p>Výše zmíněné technologické revoluce mají leccos společného. Jejich působení na existující společenský řád je mimořádné, a to i z toho důvodu, jak se má analýza, která přitakala McLuhanovy, snažila ukázat, že společenské přijetí a proliferace technologie vyžaduje, aby technologie na sebe nabalila společenské hodnoty tak, aby byla společensky užitečná a širší společností uchopitelná. U knihtisku dialog s “uživatelem” nebyl tak potřeba jako u digitálního počítače, který vyžaduje prostředníka v podobě uživatelského rozhraní, které zprostředkovává vztah mezi lidskou kulturou a kulturou stroje.</p>\n<p>Vzrůstající role designéra uživatelského rozhraní není náhodná. Technologičtí giganti si dobře uvědomují, že výkon, cloudové řešení nebo vyspělé algoritmy jsou sice nutnou, ale nikoli dostatečnou podmínkou jakéhokoli produktu, jež aspoň v minimální rovině má být používán lidmi. Designéři jsou stavěni do role, ve které se pohybují na pomezí precizního technologického řádu a chaosu lidského světa. Jejich práce se posunula od povrchní fetišizace estetického vzhledu ke komunikaci. Jsou tlumočníky technologie. Jejich designovým materiálem je celé ekologie informačních technologií a lidské emoce. Donedávna designéři pracovali především ve dvourozměrném prostředí bitmapové obrazovky. Na obzoru se ale o slovo hlásí technologie, která pro mě osobně, jako pozorovatele zpovzdálí, představuje možnou třetí revoluci gutenbergovského formátu. Dle mého by mohla dokončit načatou triádu autority určité kognitivní dovednosti. Viděli jsme vládnutí verbálních schopností, dnes stále formálně-matematických. Co je tou potenciální třetí revolucí? Domnívám se, že virtuální realita.</p>\n<p>Trvalo několik dekád, než se naskytly příznivé podmínky pro komerční uvedení skutečně imerzivní virtuální reality, která netrpí neduhy v podobě nízkého rozlišení, nepohodlného hardware (či spíše wearable) nebo nedostatku vyspělého a smysluplného softwaru. Nyní velcí hráči na poli technologií berou virtuální realitu seriózně. Microsoft i další firmy představují konceptuální a velmi sofistikované aplikace pro virtuální realitu, které jsou mířeny na studenty, obor medicíny, ale také architekty, umělce a designéry. Poslední zmiňovaní stojí za povšimnutí a historické srovnání.</p>\n<p>Knihtisk pro verbálně nadané jedince znamenal urychlení šíření díla od autora ke čtenáři; digitální počítač umožnil matematicky talentovaným jedincům rychleji docházet k výpočtům a řešením složitých, bez digitálních počítačů prakticky nespočitatelných úloh. Co však znamená virtuální realita? A komu tato nová technologie umožní rychleji zprostředkovat své myšlenky?</p>\n<p>Virtuální realita je v první řadě médiem vizuálním a prostorovým (a to i přesto, že zapojení dalších smyslů, například vhodného zvukového doprovodu jistě zesiluje realistický pocit z užití VR). Tvorba pro VR tak předpokládá talent pro vizualizaci ve třech rozměrech. Tento talent je tradičně rozložen mezi takové obory jako architektura, produktový design, strojírenství či teoretická fyzika, která také vyžaduje kromě matematického vzdělání schopnosti vizualizace. McLuhan použil pojmy “vizuální myšlení” a “vizuální věk” pro období ovlivněné vývojem knihtisku. Myslím si, že se unáhlil. Virtuální realita je do třetice technologií, která mění, jaký dominantní styl myšlení ve společnosti bude vládnout. A právě ona je vhodným kandidátem na započetí nového věku vizuálního myšlení.</p>\n<p>Otázkou je, zda vizuální myšlení je skutečně tak odlišná dovednost, že je platné hovořit o případném historickém období, kdy tato dovednost samostatně dominuje. Jedna z možných odpovědí zní kladně a zároveň propojuje všechny tři zmíněné technologické revoluce a s nimi spojené důrazy na odlišné kognitivní schopnosti.</p>\n<p>Podíváme-li se totiž na vědu a praxi testování kognitivních schopností pomocí IQ testu, ten nejpoužívanější z nich, Wechslerův test inteligence pro dospělé (WAIS), se dělí na verbální a non-verbální složku, kde verbální se zhruba dělí na další dvě části: jedna testující jazykové dovednosti a ta druhá dovednosti aritmetické. Neverbální složka, často také pojmenovaná jako vizuálně-prostorová testuje schopnost manipulace s třírozměrnými objekty v mysli a s tím spojené úkony.</p>\n<p>Hlavní poznání, které nám rozvržení IQ testu přináší, je fakt, že ze statistického hlediska je užitečné oddělovat verbální, matematické a vizuálně-prostorové dovednosti, neboť nejsou identické a nelze jednou dovedností uspokojivě nahradit druhou bez ztráty cenných informací o dovednostech testovaného subjektu. Neznamená to, že tyto dovednosti jsou na sobě nezávislé nebo že spolu nekorelují. Opak je pravdou, neboť člověk, který vykazuje nadprůměrný talent v jedné doméně, s vyšší pravděpodobností nezaostává i v těch ostatních. Ale rozdíly, respektive poměr rozdělení talentu v těchto třech hlavních kognitivních doménách mezi jednotlivci existují. A proto lze říct, že manifestace lidských potenciálů je závislá na sociotechnických podmínkách dané společnosti. Čím více je ekonomika a kultura ovlivňována jedním dominantních stylem myšlení, tím více se projevuje pro takový styl myšlení nerovnost distribuce nadání mezi lidmi. Za předpokladu, že talent pro vizuální myšlení je ve společnosti rozložen minimálně stejně jako třeba skóre na IQ testu, tedy normálním rozložením (dle Gaussovy křivky), je možné, že po éře literátů, matematiků a programátorů přichází v době virtuální reality nadvláda umělců, architektů a všech, kteří myslí vizuálně.</p>\n<p>Na základě předchozích dvou technologických revolucí si dovolím pro vizuální myšlení a virtuální realitu predikci. Pokud se virtuální realita stane běžnou součástí každodenních životů lidí, familiárnost s VR bude dostatečnou ekonomickou motivací, aby se pro VR vytvářely stále detailnější a reálnější HW i SW. Společenská závislost na VR se bude zvyšovat, a tím i prestiž odborníků, kteří se těší talentům, které jim dovolí vytvářet nejen specializované aplikace pro VR, nýbrž komplexní světy, do kterých čím dál tím více budou lidé “outsourcovat” svůj soukromý i společenský život. Z ryze utilitárního a edukačního užití VR se postupně stane životní styl. Estetické a zkušenostní hodnoty se budou dostávat do popředí.</p>\n<p>Virtuální realita je oproti té reálné odlišná v mnoha svých atributech, ale jeden z nich vyčnívá: virtuální realita je jediné místo na světě, snad kromě středu černých děr, kde fyzikální zákony mohou, ale nemusí platit. Ten, který vytváří imerzivní, hyperrealistickou virtuální realitu, je omezen v rozhodnutí o tom, jaký virtuální svět to bude, jen svou (vizuální) představivostí.</p>\n<p>Pokud ale VR bude k nerozeznání od reálného světa, znamená to, že přestanou existovat morální, etické, souhrnně filosofické otázky, které jsou nedílnou součástí našich lidských životů? Virtuální realita může sloužit jako velký myšlenkový experiment, kde nevyřešené filosofické otázky budou testovány, a je možné, že jiné fyzikální zákony, jiné formy toho, co znamená být člověkem, vhrnou na staré problémy nové světlo generující problémy a otázky nové. Pak se mi ale zdá, že se bez filosofie neobejdeme. Bude ale na těchto nových filosofických otázkách pracovat člověk, nebo nová, virtuální realitu nahrazující technologie, náš poslední vynález, který vyvrcholí ve čtvrtou technologickou revoluci měnící dominantní styl myšlení doby. Doby, ve které se může stát, že slovní spojení “lidský styl myšlení” bude buď archaismus, nebo rovnou oxymóron.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h.dmh1ppmwv0f0\">Závěr</h2>\n<p>Tato esej mapuje pole myšlenek, které se přímo či nepřímo zabývají chápáním technologických revolucí nejen jako sociálních a technologických milníků, ale také revolucí určitého druhu myšlení. Toto myšlení po dostatečném zavedení technologie do širší společnosti pomocí funkce zpětné vazby se začíná privilegovat, čímž jsou zvýhodňováni lidé, kteří mají kognitivní kapacitu a talent tuto poptávku uspokojit. Jako příkladné technologie, jejichž vliv byl v eseji zkoumán, jsem zvolil knihtisk, digitální informační technologie a virtuální realitu, které chronologicky privilegovaly nejdříve verbální, poté matematicko-formální a v poslední řadě vizuální myšlení. Za předpokladu, že distribuce talentu pro vizuální myšlení sleduje Gaussovu křivku, můžeme očekávat, že po vzoru literátů, matematiků a programátorů vznikne nová kognitivní elita, která pro svou práci používá vizuální myšlení. Poptávku po tomto talentu bude stimulovat vzrůstající vliv virtuální reality, jež považuji za silně vizuálně-prostorové médium.</p>\n<hr style=\"page-break-before: always; display: none;\" />\n<h2 id=\"h.5b8penyz8wgn\">Zdroje</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">FLUSSER, Vilém, 2013.

Zatímco Obama byl za svůj akt v roce 2008 odměněn americkou asociací </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: italic;\">Association of National Advertisers</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> jako marketér roku</span><sup style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref1\" href=\"#ftnt1\">[1]</a></sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: normal;\">, Trump musel nejednou v médiích vysvětlovat skutečný význam některých svých Twitter příspěvků. Ať už jsou na povrchu tyto politické kampaně protiklady, mají minimálně dvě věci společné: nejen, že pochopily význam nových médií, ale zároveň v obou případech pomohly kandidátům volby vyhrát. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obamův mediální tým nicméně využíval nová média ze strategicky jiného důvodu. Obama od začátku měl velmi slibný a uvěřitelný příběh, který jen stačilo zviditelnit a vhodně prodat. Jako (poloviční) afroameričan dosáhl na většinu možných met amerického života, označovaných sourhně jako „americký sen“, čímž reprezentoval stanovisko či spíše naději mnoha lidí, že Amerika se již postupně dostala do post-rasové fáze, kde skutečně i lidé z minoritních komunit mohou dosáhnout svých cílů, jen pokud ze sebe vydají maximum (vidíme zde odvolávání se na neumírající čistokrevně americký a protestanský étos tvrdé práce). Jestli slogan „Hope“ k něčemu odkazoval, byla to naděje jednou provždy ukázat, že se Státy úspěšně vyléčily z historie oprese a rasismu. Krátce po svém zvolení Obama vyhrál Nobelovu cenu míru</span><sup style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref2\" href=\"#ftnt2\">[2]</a></sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, která vyzdvihovala jeho snahu volit dialog a spolupráci namísto vojenského zásahu, čímž se znatelně lišil od svého předchůdce. Přesto tato udělená Nobelova cena bude patřit k těm nejkontroverznějším, neboť právě za Obamy se začalo hlasitěji mluvit o jiném informačně-technologickém prostředku vládnutí, tedy o bezpilotních letounech, neboli </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dronech, které v rámci „Obamovy dronové kampaně“</span><sup style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref3\" href=\"#ftnt3\">[3]</a></sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, jak dnes již víme, zabily nejen stovky civilistů</span><sup style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref4\" href=\"#ftnt4\">[4]</a></sup><sup style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref5\" href=\"#ftnt5\">[5]</a></sup><sup style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref6\" href=\"#ftnt6\">[6]</a></sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, ale někteří vlivní komentátoři politického dění, jako např. prof. Noam Chomsky, opakovaně deklarovali, že Obamova dronová kampaň je „nejrozsáhlejší globální teroristickou kampaní, kterou svět viděl“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><sup style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref7\" href=\"#ftnt7\">[7]</a></sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nová i stará média za Obamova vládnutí také přinesla radikální zhoršení rasových vztahů, neboť umožnila pomocí video záznamů na smartphonech až příliš rychlé zhodnocení situace bez toho, aniž by se počkalo na oficiální a racionálnější verdikt soudu. Statistiky společnosti Gallup uvádí, že v období Obamova vládnutí se počet lidí, kteří „se velmi obávají [špatných] rasových vztahů“, přibližně zdvojnásobil</span><sup style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref8\" href=\"#ftnt8\">[8]</a></sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. V neposlední řadě skvrnu na Nobelovce Obamovi přinesl skandál při odhalení odposlouchávání amerických občanů i světových lídrů, na které upozornila kauza Snowden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I výše nastíněná výchozí situace, do které Donald Trump přicházel jako kandidát na prezidenta, je důvodem, proč Trumpova volební kampaň a potenciální využití sociálních médií byla ve výsledku více „disruptivní“ než by se mohlo zdát. Jistě, Trump nepotřeboval nová média k tomu, aby ukázal americkému voliči, kdo že je, protože se již desítky let těší masové popularitě srovnatelné s pop hvězdami. Trump využil Twitter a Facebook jinak. Využil je paradoxně tak, jak jsme si je vždy přestavovali: jako alternativní kanály, rezistentní vůči cenzuře, které upevňují demokracii, svobodu slova a umožňují šířit i nepopulární názory. A šířit nepopulární názory, to Trump rozhodně dělal. Z tohoto pohledu by se mohlo zdát, že Trump je ukázkou funkční demokracie: vyhrál, přestože jej oficiálně nepodpořily žádná velká tisková média, zatímco protikandidátku Clintonovou de facto všechny</span><sup style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref9\" href=\"#ftnt9\">[9]</a></sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Tím, že Trump obešel všechna velká „legacy“ média a přesto vyhrál volby, by pro všechny teoretiky měl být fenomenální výsledek vhodný podrobnější analýze, zvláště když veškeré standardní výzkumy a predikce také selhaly, neboť ještě těsně před volebním večerem nedávaly Trumpovi skoro žádnou šanci; až na Natana Silvera a jeho FiveThirtyEight web, kteří jako jediní dávali Trumpovi šanci pohybující se okolo 29 %, kdežto např. New York Times mezi 1—15 %</span><sup style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref10\" href=\"#ftnt10\">[10]</a></sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: normal;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: normal;\">Kromě svého Twitter účtu měl Trump na poli nových médií ještě jednu zbraň, respektive hned několik zbraní: youtubery a ryze online zpravodajské servery. Přibližně od léta 2016 jsem začal podrobněji zkoumat, jací lidé a jaký online obsah motivuje potenciální voliče k volbě Donalda Trumpa. Skupina lidí, kteří se kolem Trumpa semknuli, si začala říkat alternativní pravice, zkráceně alt-right. Jsou to lidé, kteří v Trumpovi viděli a mnozí stále vidí symbol člověka, které se dokáže postavit globalistickým tendencím, které upozaďují Stát jako sjednocující jednotku, a naopak preferují méně či více radikální prvky nacionalismu. Jakkoli tuto vizi a víru v Donalda Trumpa hodnotíme, tato agenda byla centrem Trumpovi podpory, minimálně v online kruzích. Mezi nejvlivnější online média argumentující pro Trumpa bych zařadil následující weby a youtube osobnosti: Breitbart News, Infowars, Richard Spencer, Milo Yiannopoulos, Stefan Molyneux a mnoho dalších.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nejen, že tyto online kanály se co do počtu sledujících vyrovnají tištěným médiím, v jejich prospěch často také hrála nízká sebekázeň a nepřesnost tištěných médií, která se během voleb i po nich nejednou ukázala, když například v CNN během volebních kampaní ignorovali proslov Bernie Sanderse k tisícům fanouškům a místo toho v ten samý okamžik vysílali prázdné pódium kampaně Donalda Trumpa, kde se zatím stále čekalo na jeho příchod</span><sup style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref11\" href=\"#ftnt11\">[11]</a></sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; když vlivné New York Times editovaly (bez explicitní poznámky editora, jak je to standardně v oboru zvykem) již vydaný článek, tak aby zněl negativněji</span><sup style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref12\" href=\"#ftnt12\">[12]</a></sup><sup style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref13\" href=\"#ftnt13\">[13]</a></sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; nebo když Washington Post vydal články o údajném ruském hackování elektrických stanic ve státě Vermont</span><sup style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref14\" href=\"#ftnt14\">[14]</a></sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: normal;\">, což by byl mezinárodní skandál, možná hraničící s válečným činem, kdyby to vše ale byla pravda, a ne lež.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Počet a nezodpovědnost skandálů tradičních velikánů tištěného zpravodajství byly velké. I kvůli negativnímu biasu</span><sup style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref15\" href=\"#ftnt15\">[15]</a></sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: normal;\"> si lidé pamatují ať už škobrtnutí, či rovnou cílené lži mnohem více než kvalitní a objektivní zpravodajství. V informačním věku mají informace kvantitativně vyšší moc než kdy dříve. To s sebou přináší i problémy: informační zahlcení. Více a více lidé outsourcují přemýšlení nad událostmi ke svým vybraným mediálním kanálům, jež logicky slouží jako filtr a „médium“ v pravém slova smyslu k „reálnému světu“.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: normal;\">Pokud tyto filtry ztratí důvěru, lidé se mohou buď obrátit jinam — k alternativám, které jsou nativními online médii, nebo využívat čím dál více populární volby tzv. fact-checkerů, které konceptuálně představují jakási „meta-média“, neboť informují o tom, jako ostatní média informují.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nedůvěra médiím a boj s tzv. fake news jsou bodem, kde se v administraci prezidenta Trumpa potkává politika a informace. Příznivci Trumpa jsou minimálně stejně skeptičtí vůči tradičním médiím jako on sám. Díky silnému politickému mandátu, který Trump a Republikáni nyní mají v obou komorách, a tomu, že republikánští voliči vyjadřují silnou nevoli vůči médií</span><sup style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref16\" href=\"#ftnt16\">[16]</a></sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, si Trump může dovolit při návrhu státního rozpočtu kompletně ukončit financování veřejných rozhlasových služeb jako Public broadcasting National Public Radio (NPR) nebo Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)</span><sup style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref17\" href=\"#ftnt17\">[17]</a></sup></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: normal;\">Jeden úhel pohledu by takový krok označil za útok na informační svobodu, druhý, řekněme tržně orientovaný by naopak argumentoval, že po skandálních nepřesnostech a rozšíření fake news by Stát neměl řídit veřejné instituce a neměl by daňové poplatníky nutit za určitá média platit, a místo toho jim dát možnost volby. Spíše než autoritářský krok se jedná o rozpor v politicko-ekonomické ideologii. Libertariánský či konzervativní proud Trumpovy administrace tak ve skutečnosti nedělá nic jiného než implementuje svůj program, který vyhrál volby. V kontextu České republiky by takový krok byl skandální, avšak nezapomínejme, že kontext hraje roli a americký pohled na relativně malý Stát a konzervativní ekonomické programy je zcela někde jinde: historicky pár století, společensky a kulturně několik tisíc kilometrů.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: normal;\">Jako relativně nezávislý pozorovatel vidím ve zrušení veřejných mediálních institucí určitou návaznost na globálnější změny v tom, jak lidé konzumují informace. Můžeme očekávat, že klasická „stará“ média budou s námi věčně? Pokud se ukazuje, že je lidé využívají méně a méně, neměly by se co nejdříve transformovat tak, aby reagovali na to, co lidé chtějí, a to nemyslím teď z hlediska obsahu, ale formy, mediality samotné? Zruší-li se Státem posvěcené instituce, pro některé zde vznikne až příliš velká volnost trhu, příliš velký výběr, kde nebude možné rozeznat objektivní fakta od lží. Jakmile onen maják, ke kterému všichni vzhlíží, aby jim pomohl rozeznat pravdu od nepravdu, zanikne, vznikne poptávka po jeho náhradě. Informační zalhcení je enormní a lidé potřebují outsourcovat analýzu informací na někoho jiného. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: normal;\">Právě zde vidím zajímavý potenciál budoucího směřování informační svobody v USA: webové projekty věnující se fact-checkingu se nejen rozmnoží, ale zlepší svou kvalitu, jelikož právě kvalita zdrojů, analýzy a vysvětlení, včetně zjevné politické nezávislosti, budou hlavní ekonomická aktiva těchto projektů, která se mohou blížit standardnímu akademickému procesu recenzování. Stačí vhodná platforma. Pokud navíc bude otevřená, podobající se otevřenému akademickému recenzování, může prvotní destruktivní krok vést k něčemu novému, co mimo jiné zarputilí odpůrci Trumpovy administrace, tak či onak ve vztahu k informacím požadují: Open Access, přesnost, transparentnost a svobodu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: normal;\">Takové myšlení je na jednu stranu spekulativní, na druhou se ale snaží přesáhnout tradiční smýšlení, které reaguje na politické kroky pouze skrze to, co reflektuje a naplňuje můj momentální politický program a ideologii. Pokud bude rozpočen schválen a veřejné mediální instituce na základě toho postupně rozpuštěny, odpůrci Trumpovy administrace by mimo tradiční protestní pochody, které se bohužel v posledních dnech neobejdou bez násilí, měli tuto situaci chápat jako příležitost, jak využít nových médií k re-designování masové distribuce a příjmu informací specificky navržené pro 21. století. Pokud se nepletu, byla to vždy levice, která myslela futuristicky a utopisticky. A Trumpova éra dává těmto dvěma módům myšlení dostatek stimulace a materiálu.  </span></p>\n<hr />\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"ftnt1\" href=\"#ftnt_ref1\">[1]</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\"> http://adage.com/article/moy-2008/obama-wins-ad-age-s-marketer-year/131810/</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"ftnt2\" href=\"#ftnt_ref2\">[2]</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\"> http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2009/press.html</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"ftnt3\" href=\"#ftnt_ref3\">[3]</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\"> https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"ftnt4\" href=\"#ftnt_ref4\">[4]</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\"> http://securitydata.newamerica.net/drones/yemen-analysis.html</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"ftnt5\" href=\"#ftnt_ref5\">[5]</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\"> https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-01-01/drone-wars-the-full-data</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"ftnt6\" href=\"#ftnt_ref6\">[6]</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\"> http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/01/12/reflecting-on-obamas-presidency/obamas-embrace-of-drone-strikes-will-be-a-lasting-legacy</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"ftnt7\" href=\"#ftnt_ref7\">[7]</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\"> Např.: http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/03/19/noam_chomsky_obamas_drone_assassination_program_is_the_most_extensive_global_terrorism_campaign_the_world_has_yet_seen.html</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"ftnt8\" href=\"#ftnt_ref8\">[8]</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\"> http://www.gallup.com/poll/190574/worries-race-relations-reach-new-high.aspx</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"ftnt9\" href=\"#ftnt_ref9\">[9]</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\"> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper_endorsements_in_the_United_States_presidential_election,_2016</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"ftnt10\" href=\"#ftnt_ref10\">[10]</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\"> http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"ftnt11\" href=\"#ftnt_ref11\">[11]</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\"> http://www.rawstory.com/2016/03/amy-goodman-rips-cnn-for-airing-trumps-empty-stage-instead-of-sanders-speech/</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"ftnt12\" href=\"#ftnt_ref12\">[12]</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\"> http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/how-the-new-york-times-sandbagged-bernie-sanders-20160315?page=2</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"ftnt13\" href=\"#ftnt_ref13\">[13]</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\"> http://www.salon.com/2016/03/16/new_york_times_busted_for_anti_bernie_bias_the_iconic_clinton_endorsing_newspaper_slyly_edits_article_to_smear_sanders/</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"ftnt14\" href=\"#ftnt_ref14\">[14]</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\"> https://theintercept.com/2016/12/31/russia-hysteria-infects-washpost-again-false-story-about-hacking-u-s-electric-grid/</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"ftnt15\" href=\"#ftnt_ref15\">[15]</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\"> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"ftnt16\" href=\"#ftnt_ref16\">[16]</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\"> http://thehill.com/homenews/media/318514-trump-admin-seen-as-more-truthful-than-news-media-poll</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"ftnt17\" href=\"#ftnt_ref17\">[17]</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; color: #1a1a1a; text-decoration: normal;\"> http://fortune.com/2017/03/16/trump-budget-public-broadcasting/</span></p>\n</div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jestliže dnes již bývalý prezident Barack Obama získal svůj post nejvlivnějšího muže planety díky bezprecedentnímu využití sociálních médií a guerrilla marketingu své osobnosti, Donald Trump během voleb i dnes zůstává v nových i starých médiích centrem kontroverze a nejednoho politicky nekorektního faux pas.

Aniž bych tvrdil, že má interpretace je originální, začnu tím, že výčet podtémat konceptu informační společnosti, které mi nejen pomohly objasnit, o čem koncept IF je, ale i jaké problémy obsahuje. Dále pak naznačím specifická témata konceptu IF, které ovlivňují mé myšlení i v dalších spřízněných akademických oblastech.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mezi hlavní témata diskuze o informační společnosti řadím základní problematizaci toho, zdali informační společnost, jakožto společnost založená na tvorbě, mediaci a zpracování informací, je něco nového, nebo naopak informace byly vždy součástí lidské společnosti. Odpovědi na tuto otázku se liší a většinou se dělí na dva tábory, kde jedna strana, do které patří na příklad Daniel Bell, tvrdí, že ano, a druhá, zastoupena sociologem Manuelem Castellsem, argumentuje, že užití informací není tak kritické, jako spíše, co kvantitativní nárust informací umožnil. Pro Castellse nárůst informačního užití ve společnost dal vzniknout nové společnosti, která se formuje kolem do topologie sítí. Tyto dva tábory ještě spojuje diskuze nad tím, jak a kdy přesně kvantitativní nárůst informací (či ve filosofické rovině kvantitativní nárůst čehokoli) se transformuje do nárůst nebo změn kvalitativních. Zde si dovolím souhlasit s těmi, kteří zdůrazňují nutnost pojmout změny kvalitativně, nebo samotná kvantita nám neposkytuje důležitý indikátor: význam těchto změn. Lze si zde vzpomenout na Marshalla McLuhana, který rozpoznal, že konkrétních využitích média je mnoho, co ale skutečně změnilo společnost, je právě uvedení daného média a jeho fukčních kapacit do společnosti. Obsah je více či méně zajímavý a důležitý, co ale zcela přináší revoluční změny do společnosti, je právě nové médium, což je stručně vyjadřuje jeho známé diktum: The medium is the message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Informační společnost jako koncept je tedy založena netriviálním způsobem na informacích. Jejich tvorba a šíření je ale zprostředkována právě nějakým médiem, což je konkrétně nějaká technologie. Jestliže tedy informace mění společnost, neméně důležitou roli v této změně hraje technologie, který ty změny technicky umožňuje. Podle Franka Webstera je takové pojetí termínu IF jednou z jejích definic. Pro mě osobně je to definice zajímavá, protože z ní vyplývá, že technika (technologie) hraje aktivní roli při formování struktur a chodu společnosti. Z pohledu filosofie techniky je pak dále důležité zodpovědět, jak moc je tato aktivní role techniky závislá opětovně na společnosti. Pokud by nebyla, mluvili bychom o konceptu </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">technologického determinismu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, který je, pokud se nemýlím, teoretiky odmítán, neboť staví techniku mimo společnost, jako samostatně žijící organismus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Přikláním se k tomu, že technika a společnost existují v symbiotickém vztahu, kde jako v symbolu ying yang se ovlivňují mechanismem zpětné smyčky (feedback loop) navzájem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Další mé chápání termínu IF směřuje k tomu, jak důraz na informace mění společnost z ekonomicko-pracovního pohledu a jaký typ práce je upřednostňován, což opět mění podobu společnosti, protože lidé, kteří dříve nebyli na základě svého kognitivního profilu schopni dosáhnout vlivného postavení, jsou dnes v popředí společensko-technických změn. Mluvím zde o lidech s podprůměrnými verbálními schopnosti, ale vynikajícími talentem pro kvantitativní uvažování, mezi které zhruba považujme matematicko-logické myšlení. Tato problematika mě vede k jedné pro mě z nejdůležitějších a nejzajímavějších otázek: povede vzdělanost a technická vyspělost paradoxně k radikálnímu poklesu tradiční gramotnosti, vzdělání a společenských dovedností, neboť příliš velký důraz na kvantitativní talent z těchto historicky důležitých dovednosti udělá dovednost irelevantní? Ačkoli je odvážné říct, že tyto dovednosti jsou na sobě nezávislé (i když na úrovni kognice a struktury mozku tomu tak nejspíše je), společnost, ale i pracovní trh má v tomto jednoznačně jasno: člověk s doktorátem z teoretické fyziky se může těšit na lukrativní kariéru ve financích, datové analýze či vědě, kdežto doktorát z anglické literatury takovou jistotu, z pohledu statistického průměru, nepřináší. Přináší důraz na kvantitativní dovednosti nový druh nerovnosti ve společnosti?</span></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Stephen Wolfram možná přemýšlí o tom, jestli celý vesmír není komputační proces Subjektivní názor a pochopení termínu informační společnosti jsou nezbytně formovány již nabytými akademickými znalostmi a diskuzemi, kterými si člověk projde, přesto využiji toho, že každá látka, téma a idea utkví v mysli pouze tehdy, pokud je nějak interpretována, zasazena do širšího a již [&hellip;]</p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":967,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[9,11],"tags":[229],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wolfram.png","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/965"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=965"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/965/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":996,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/965/revisions/996"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/media/967"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=965"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=965"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=965"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":953,"date":"2017-02-13T15:40:13","date_gmt":"2017-02-13T14:40:13","guid":{"rendered":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/?p=953"},"modified":"2017-02-15T20:09:49","modified_gmt":"2017-02-15T19:09:49","slug":"chatbots-ux-and-digital-health","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/2017/02/chatbots-ux-and-digital-health/","title":{"rendered":"Chatbots, UX and Digital Health"},"content":{"rendered":"<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Introduction</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As software, chatbots recognize and respond properly to a user’s text or voice messages. Due to the complexity of a natural-language processing, the user is often constrained to a set of available commands. In messenger-like apps, the user selects them through a graphical user interface. Chatbots can also be regarded as an evolutionary step in the design and development of human-computer interaction. Whereas the common desktop metaphor replaced the command-line decades ago, the ongoing convergence of smart, mobile technologies and the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning enables a user-friendly control of computers through the natural language. The language can be thought of as a natural user interface (NUI). The word “natural” implies the possibility to take advantage of a user’s innate skills, reducing the difference between a novice and long-time user. Therefore, chatbots as NUI are “leveraging the potential of modern technologies to better mirror human capabilities” (Wigdor &amp; Wixon, p. 10), significantly lowering the entry barriers, costs and time devoted to learning a new product or service. When compared to virtual reality or Xbox Kinect, the Wigdor and Wixon’s call for using the modern input technology does not play a central part in chatbot development; however, their potential to accelerate the full integration of technology into our lives and fulfil the promise of ubiquitous computing is certainly present. With chatbots we are on the brink of a next paradigm shift, from the design of graphical layouts to AI-powered software where a conversation is simultaneously the medium and content of user experiences. We can call it a “conversational interface” (Knight 2016).</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rise of chatbots</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chatbots represent a point where two prominent features of human culture intersect: the emphasis on the verbal expression which is unique to humans, and the post-industrial logic of design and production, structured around the just-in-time delivery, personalized content, one-to-one communication, and adjusting based on the immediate context. We find all these features in any typical conversation. The conversational element of chatbots is also stressed by the industry. Satya Nadella and Microsoft announced their commitment to chatbots, stating that the rise of chatbots “is inevitable” (Pall) and describe “a conversation as a platform”. (Microsoft News Center). The attributes critical to a successful conversation are, among other things, the sensitivity to contextual clues and delivering content that is meaningful and useful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital technology and designers have been answering these demands since the beginning of personal computing. The human-computer interaction field, or HCI, arose from the need to study and propose solutions to ease the use of computer technology. During its first-wave, the HCI field brought about developments in understanding of cognitive aspects of computer use that eventually materialised in usability engineering guidelines and suggestions. After the advent of mobile computing — in a mainstream culture largely recognized as the introduction of Apple iPhone in 2007 — the HCI field as well as interaction designers had to take into account the temporal and spatial dimensions of technology use, thus accepting the broader changes in human-computer relationship, where technology moved from a periphery of specialized problem-solving domains to the central positions as a cultural artefact. Apps, which developers crafted with mobile context and experiences in mind, started to dominate. Web designers reacted accordingly, discovering the mix of front-end technologies and browser-supported functionalities that allowed the Web platform to become “responsive” to the variety of browsers, display sizes, and different contextual capabilities of devices. The proof-of-concept itself was introduced in 2010. Following three years, the concept became a trend, when a well-known site in the industry, Mashable, called 2013 the year of responsive web design. The mass adoption of responsive web design coincided with what the data and statistics had been showing: it was the year 2012 when a smartphone use surpassed desktops and notebooks (counted together).</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rachel-hinman-rise-of-mobile-devices.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-954\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rachel-hinman-rise-of-mobile-devices.png\" alt=\"Rachel Hinman - The rise of mobile device\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rachel-hinman-rise-of-mobile-devices.png 941w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rachel-hinman-rise-of-mobile-devices-300x186.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rachel-hinman-rise-of-mobile-devices-768x477.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Smartphones surpass desktops and notebooks<br />\n(Figure 1: Hinman, p. 98)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two years later, another shift occurred when statistics showed that, for the first time, the users in the US spent more time using apps on their mobile devices than using anything else on desktops. (Murtagh) Finally, in the 1Q of 2015 the fraction of mobile functionality, the messaging, overshadowed not only the the other mobile apps, but also the social networking apps.

Therefore chatbots are new digital music or apps, where the equivalences to iTunes and Apple store platforms are Facebook Messenger, Amazon’s Alexa, Skype, Telegram, Kik, Slack and other upcoming solutions to the chatbot-enabled platforms. To asses the “burgeoning bot economy”, Business Insider summarizes its report on chatbots by stating that:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Chatbots could be lucrative for messaging apps and the developers who build bots for these platforms, similar to how app stores have developed into moneymaking ecosystems.” (Beaver)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mentioned tech companies provide a shop-like list of bots, except for Facebook and its Messenger, which has not released its own centralised shop to date, although the profiles of prominent users such as CNN or Barack Obama already provide a chatbot-enhanced messaging, whose capabilities range from news to music suggestions.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chatbots in Digital Health</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The digital health turn that reshapes the ingrained processes of medical practice has delivered so far many smart devices bundled with biosensors, mobiles apps analysing data and other digital services. While these solutions offer personalised data and suggestions, the real disruptive step seems to come from the interaction of the new digital ecosystems and the old, albeit well-established, and necessarily conservative environment of the public healthcare systems. It is for this transition that chatbots may play a lead role by embodying the function of a virtual assistant, bridging the gap between patients and clinicians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Powered by AI and machine learning algorithms, chatbots are forecasted to save “health care costs when used in place of a human, such as a preliminary step of helping to assess a condition and providing self-care recommendations” (&#8222;The chatbot will see you now: AI may play doctor in the future of healthcare&#8220; 2016) Such prediction is reinforced by the recent successful attempts to automate diagnosis of mental health issues by the analysis of speech patterns with 100% predictive power. (Bedi, et al. 2015)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The digital health field is already saturated with chatbots. The company Your.MD provides a chatbot solution based on the machine-learning algorithms and natural-language processing that predicts probabilities between the symptoms and conditions, which are analysed on the background of a user’s personal profile. (&#8222;The chatbot will see you now: AI may play doctor in the future of healthcare&#8220; 2016)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TigerConnect offers secure, encrypted, HIPAA compliant messaging platform and chatbots, helping to foster communication between clinicians and patients by providing EHR/EMR records management, physician appointments, patient adherence etc.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another high-profile chatbot deployment came from the announcement of National Health Service in the UK, which intends to betatest chatbots with </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babylon, a UK-based telemedicine startup, supporting video conferencing with doctors, in order to “ replace NHS 111, a non-emergency phone hotline staffed by call center workers who aren&#8217;t necessarily medical professionals”. (&#8222;UK&#8217;s NHS will test Babylon&#8217;s triage chatbot to replace non-emergency hotline&#8220; 2017)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among many others stands out the Amazon’s Alexa-based app created with the cooperation of Boston Children’s Hospital called KidsMD. Compared to the previously mentioned chatbot solutions relying on the text-based messages, KidsMD is a voice-recognition app that has been tested at patients’ homes and hospitals as well. Parents can used the app to obtain information about common illnesses and quick treatments, all of which is curated by doctors and accessible on the cloud. The app also helps doctors to take notes and photographs with crucial metadata while operating. (Bailey 2016)</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\f</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Summary</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quest of Digital Health for optimizing the Patient Engagement Experience (PEx) and the general process of interacting with patients will benefit most from adopting chatbots and voice-recognition apps in the cases where the preliminary assessment is routine enough to be automated. The possibilities to streamline a patient-doctor communication exist as we could see in the examples such as KidsMD or Babylon’s trial with NHS in the UK. The more chatbots will become employed in the whole digital and mobile universe, the more familiar they will be to patients willing to try them as alternatives. However, the direct link to doctors will not go away and is currently being deployed in several projects. If the Babylon-NHS cooperation succeeds, other major transformations in public sector health may follow, stimulating the whole Digital Health industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from the technical aspects, chatbots are a service and as such directly intertwined with human beings, their skills, fears, prejudices and cognitive spans, which means that chatbots as any service must be designed with a human in mind. It has been said that from the perspective of User interface design, the development of chatbots is less concerned with the visual, and focuses more on the narrative, conversational dimensions. Chatbots pose new challenges to the whole HCI/UX community, which requires their reorientation to the new platform. Therefore, we can expect a time delay between the available technological opportunities and appropriate design solutions that will emerge some time later, after designers test and find functional design patterns that work for all the stakeholders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, we have to assume that the extreme use cases and users-outliers will constitute major dilemmas as far as ethical and legal issues are concerned. What should chatbot do in case of a dying patient? What would be the legal ramifications when the bug occurs and causes health damages? Those questions are pertinent and hopefully will be sorted out soon, so that Digital Health will be rejuvenated by yet another digital transformation, this time spawned by the progress in AI research.</span></p>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bailey, Melissa. &#8222;‘Alexa, pull those lab results’: A hospital tries out virtual assistants.&#8220; </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STAT</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Vznikly nové obory, posunuli jsme se od fyzického světa k digitálnimu, mnoho teoretiků si uvědomilo, že dovednosti a metody designérů lze využít nejen pro návrh objektů, ale i pro společenské změny. A právě o tomhle potenciálu designu chci mluvit. </span></p>\n<div class=\"image\"><a href=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1-BvzzZVF1dFwgI3cshlA6Fg.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-939\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1-BvzzZVF1dFwgI3cshlA6Fg-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1-BvzzZVF1dFwgI3cshlA6Fg-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1-BvzzZVF1dFwgI3cshlA6Fg-300x169.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1-BvzzZVF1dFwgI3cshlA6Fg-768x432.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abychom pochopili neobyčejný potenciál designu, obraťme se naopak na zcela obyčejný objekt: PET láhev. Jakou má funkci? Jaký má význam? Většina lidí řekne, že lze z ní pít a její tvar byl specificky navržen pro tohle použití. Platí zde starý známý slogan „forma následuje funkci“.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lidé ale používají PET láhev i jinak, třeba v udržitelného zahradničení, kde PET láhev rázem nabývá nejen nové funkce: květináče, ale i zcela opačného významu: od symbolu plýtvání plastem se stává nástrojem pro lepší svět.</span> Ale hlavně funkce následuje formu<b>! </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Protože na základě tvaru si lidé řekli, že bude mít funkci květináče.</span></p>\n<p>K čemu jsme se dobrali? Vidíme, že významy a funkce objektů nejsou fixní, ale sociálně konstruované, závislé na kontextu, člověku, náhodě, kreativitě apod.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proč tomu tak je? Jakmile totiž vypustíme objekty do světa, tak, metaforicky řečeno, srůstávají v komplexní síti plné věcí, lidí, vztahů, kontextů a myšlenek. A abychom pochopili nejen funkce, ale také význam věcí, musíme je zasadit do širší perspektivy, musíme se na ně podívat jako na systém.</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\"><a href=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/structure_test_02.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-940\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/structure_test_02-1024x832.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/structure_test_02-1024x832.jpg 1024w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/structure_test_02-300x244.jpg 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/structure_test_02-768x624.jpg 768w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/structure_test_02.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benjamin Bratton popisuje jeden z možných pohledů na svět jako systém. Nazývá ho Stoh, který se skládá z několika úrovní, kde každá úroveň poskytuje prostředky dalším. Je to planetární megastruktura složená ze sítí, cloudu, mobilních aplikací, smart cities, internetu věcí.</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\"><a href=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Stack-02.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-941\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Stack-02-1024x809.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Stack-02-1024x809.png 1024w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Stack-02-300x237.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Stack-02-768x607.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nutno říci, že takový systém se neustále mění a je chaotický. Tak chaotický, že vytvářet pro něj něco, co má být dokonale funkční je iluzí. Design spíše než o funkčnosti je o ne-funkčnosti, a dočasných záplatách.</span></p>\n<p>To neznamená, že by designéři byli proti chaosu bezmocní, v čem jsou totiž unikátní je právě jejich talent se pohybovat v neurčitosti. Jakoby se rádi brodili blátem chaosu, ve kterém jsou schopni vytvářet nové vzorce, nové významy a nové funkce.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Design je tak způsob bytí, které stojí na pomezí chaosu a řádu. Designér je pravý Ubermench Friedricha Nietzscheho, neboť vytváří v tomto světě vlastní nové hodnoty, přesně jak Nietzsche žádal. Designér je teoretik a praktik, je doslova filosof s kladivem, který neničí, ale vytváří.</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\"><a href=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/riaR2Gw21QmnRBa4JrNP8pqGJvKnVgblBJCIyH91yLJ6okczfDtoNngfNjy4Tc0X6bCW25VpCiV1jAwLuJGDxFT-UAAymFiizqDootLGDPXSHnXV3fxjUrUdaazQBt4oYdPYlGycjL8.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-942\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/riaR2Gw21QmnRBa4JrNP8pqGJvKnVgblBJCIyH91yLJ6okczfDtoNngfNjy4Tc0X6bCW25VpCiV1jAwLuJGDxFT-UAAymFiizqDootLGDPXSHnXV3fxjUrUdaazQBt4oYdPYlGycjL8.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/riaR2Gw21QmnRBa4JrNP8pqGJvKnVgblBJCIyH91yLJ6okczfDtoNngfNjy4Tc0X6bCW25VpCiV1jAwLuJGDxFT-UAAymFiizqDootLGDPXSHnXV3fxjUrUdaazQBt4oYdPYlGycjL8.png 550w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/riaR2Gw21QmnRBa4JrNP8pqGJvKnVgblBJCIyH91yLJ6okczfDtoNngfNjy4Tc0X6bCW25VpCiV1jAwLuJGDxFT-UAAymFiizqDootLGDPXSHnXV3fxjUrUdaazQBt4oYdPYlGycjL8-150x150.png 150w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/riaR2Gw21QmnRBa4JrNP8pqGJvKnVgblBJCIyH91yLJ6okczfDtoNngfNjy4Tc0X6bCW25VpCiV1jAwLuJGDxFT-UAAymFiizqDootLGDPXSHnXV3fxjUrUdaazQBt4oYdPYlGycjL8-300x300.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></a></div>\n<p>Jak se přesně designér pohybuje v oné chaotické síti? Že myslí systémově. Systémové uvažování znamená schopnost myslet na makroskopických i mikroskopických úrovních, schopnost vidět nové vztahy a zároveň vědět, že celek je víc než součet jeho částí.</p>\n<p>Začnu ukázkou toho, jak to vypadá, když se nemyslí systémově, na příklad architektonický plán Paříže, který navrhl Le Corbusier. Jelikož nemyslel systémově, ignoroval lidské potřeby zeleně, pocitu pohodlí a bezpečí, a tak navrhl velký, mrtvý, betonový hřbitov.</p>\n<p>Naopak, příkladem systémové myšlení je iPhone. Dle mého byl úspěšný hlavně proto, že umožnoval, aby sami uživatelé vyplnili onu komplexní síť, ve které se iphone jako objekt nachází, vlastními významy a funkcemi. Jak? Iphone je jakousi nádobou-platformou, do které přidáváme aplikace, které jsou pak samotné funkce a významy.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IPhone totiž neznamená pro uživatele jenom telefon. Znamená spojení s babičkou, když jsem v zahraničí, znamená hledání partnera, hledání práce, znamená výuku španělštiny, hraní her, čtení knihy nebo třeba i velmi velmi drahé těžítko, když se rozbije.</span></p>\n<p>Systémové myšlení ale designéři mohou aplikovat nejen na objekty, ale i společnost a kulturu, dokonce ekonomické a politické problémy, které existují v šedé zóně, kde ani stát ani komerční sektor nenašly správný recept, ne kvůli nedostatku financí, ale kvůli neschopnosti kreativně spojit nesourodé věci.</p>\n<p>Nazvěme design pro sociální změnu designovým aktivismem, kdy designéři svým talentem nejen přispívají k řešení společenských problémů, ale i problémy nacházejí. Můj oblíbený příklad designového aktivismu je z Holandska, kde drahé bydlení dělá potíže jak studentům, tak seniorům. Jeden tamní projekt je příkladem chytré designové intervence, když řeší problémy obou skupin tak, že poskytuje domov seniorům, kde zároveň mladí lidé mají ubytování zdarma pod podmínkou, že se během týdne budou starat o své starší spolubydlící. Další příklad designového aktivismu je také Uber, jako disruptivní sociální inovace ale narazila na odpor a hranici samotného systému, které jsou definované politikou a zákony.</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/download.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-944\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/download.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/download.jpg 1000w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/download-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/download-768x447.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Humanitas Deventer</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zdá se, že pokud se má ve společnosti něco zásadního změnit, designéři musí otočit svou pozornost i k politice. A to se také děje. Od dánského studia MindLab, které redesignovalo státní školství, po iniciativu evropské unie Design for Europe, která podporuje inovace v byznys i veřejném sektoru.</span></p>\n<p>Znamená to, že uvidíme v politice více designérů a méně právníků a doktorů? Těžko říct, design určitě nemůže nahradit politiku, ale design jako kombinace teorie a praxe a systémového myšlení má zcela reálnou šanci měnit svět.</p>\n<p>Jaký je náš svět? Jak jistě víte, vstoupili jsme do nové éry antropocénu, kdy člověk ovlivňuje všechny planetární systémy, které se tímto stávající sociálními.

Sledujeme talentovanou lingvistku Louise Banksovou, která si v úvodních scénách filmu prožije rodinnou tragédii v podobě smrti své dcery. Střih filmu se pak rychle zaměří na současnost a doktorku Banksovou, která s lehce unaveným obličejem přichází do prostorné auly, kde ji čeká výuka. Místnost je ale skoro prázdná, většina studentů chybí. Aby toho nebylo málo, několika přítomným studentům začnou zvonit telefony, tablety a vše možné. Něco se děje. Jedna ze studentek doktorku poprosí, aby zapnula zprávy v televizi.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Přesně dvanáct vesmírných lodí ve tvaru vajíčka se rozmístilo po celé planetě. Jejich tvar je tajemný, stejně jako materiál, který připomíná jakýsi opracovaný kámen, takže vesmírné lodě vypadají jako obrovské, levitující oblázky. Střih.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doktorka Banksová sedí v pracovně u stolu ve svém útulném domě u jezera, když se u ní objeví nečekaná návštěva s ostrými rysy v podobě plukovníka Webera. Ten ji z přenosného nahrávadla přehraje zvuk, který vágně připomíná psa, když si otřepává mokrý kožich. Je to zvuk zaznamenaný při navázání komunikace s nově příchozími. Není možné, aby pouze z jednoho zvuku dokázala rozklíčovat celý jazyk. K tomu je nutné se s mimozemšťany setkat, být s nimi v osobní interakci. Trochu naivní plukovník nechápe, proč by nestačily pouze nahrávky, a nechce prozradit více. Nakonec se přeci jen Banksová stává členem týmu (jednoho z mnoha, každý stát se snaží přijít jako první s objasněním toho, co se děje), který se bude snažit s mimozemšťany navázat nějakou formu kontaktu. Je odvezena k jedné z mimozemských lodí, poblíž které stojí provizorní vojenském stanoviště, kde bude pracovat. Pomáhat ji bude druhá hlavní postava filmu, teoretický fyzik Ian Donnely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Na rozdíl od staršího snímku Kontakt, kdy mimozemšťané hlavní hrdince ulehčili intergalaktickou komunikaci tím, že se převlékli za jejího otce, Arrival s jazykem a komunikací pracuje odlišně a jeho příběh je zabalen do myšlenek, které staví na procesu odkrývání lingvistických problémů. A těch je ve filmu hned několik. Tak například Heptapodi (jak se mimozemšťanům podle jejich chapadel-chodidel ve filmu říká) používají psanou formu jazyka, která nemá nic společného s jeho mluvenou verzí. Už z tohoto důvodu nebylo možné jazyk Heptapodů analyzovat pouze z jeho zvukové podoby. Ta hraje pro Heptapody zcela odlišnou, nutno říci sekundární úlohu. Důležitá je pro ně grafická podoba jazyka, která se nerovná ničemu, co lingvistika, jak ve filmu, tak ve skutečnosti, zná. Samozřejmě, zde stojí to, co dělá Heptapody zajímavé a zároveň (mimo vzhled) velmi odlišné od lidských bytostí.  A právě osvojení si psané formy jazyka Heptapodů se tak stává ústředním tématem filmu.</span></p>\n<div class=\"image-container\">\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><div style=\"width: 1507px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.liveforfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/arrival.png\"><img class=\"size-large\" src=\"http://www.liveforfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/arrival.png\" alt=\"http://www.liveforfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/arrival.png\" width=\"1497\" height=\"787\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.liveforfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/arrival.png\">odkaz na zdroj</a></p></div></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grafická podoba jazyka Heptapodů připomíná kaligrafii zen-buddhistických mnichů. Ať už kvůli tomu, že základ veškerých heptapodských symbolů tvoří kruh, nebo pro podobnost heptapodského “psacího materiálu” s inkoustem. Nezapomínejme, že kruh, čili </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ensō</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, je pevně spjat se spirituálností zenového buddhismu, kde </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ensō </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slouží nejen jako obraz znázorňující abstraktní ideu osvícení, ale také (mnohem důležitěji) jako činnost, prostřednictvím které se jedinec k osvícení přibližuje.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mimochodem, grafickou verzi heptapodského jazyka autor Ted Chiang v původní povídce pojmenovává Heptapod B, a odděluje ji tak od orální formy, Heptapodu A. Pro zpřehlednění se tohoto pojmenování budu dále držet (mimochodem, podobné pojmenování najdeme v mykénské řečtině, kde se psaná forma oddělovala na starší Linear A, a novější Linear B; podobnost může být čistě náhodná nebo jen volnou inspirací, jedná se o mou spekulaci).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grafický jazyk Heptapod B je z několika pohledů výjimečný. Pro jednotlivé symboly, jak jsem už naznačil, neexistuje zvukové vyjádření. Kde v latince každé písmeno přibližně koresponduje s nějakým fonémem (zvukem orální formy jazyka), v Heptapodu B tento vztah neexistuje a symboly místo tradičních lingvistických prvků — jako právě fonémy, morfémy či slabiky — vyjadřují informaci či myšlenku. Jedná se tak o ideogramy, či obecněji, jak je autor sám popisuje v povídce, o </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">semasiografy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, tedy znaky, který reprezentují informace a koncepty přímo. Dalším příkladem semasiografie jsou matematické zápisy, hudební notace, dopravní značení nebo třeba vizuální ikony textového editoru, který momentálně používám.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Semasiografické symboly ale přeci lidstvo zná a denně se na ně spoléhá, když jede do práce nebo když pracuje, v tom také Heptapod B není až tak zajímavý. Jeho výjimečnost, a obecně unikátnost Heptapodů jako vesmírné rasy, je fakt, že v jednom symbolu se ukrývá hned několik významů, které jsou najednou vyjádřeny jedním symbolem a že tento symbol </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nemá začátek ani konec</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, nelze je číst jako klasický text propojených vět, kde každá věta navazuje postupně na další a mezi sebou udržují logické vztahy. Heptapod B tuto </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lineárnost</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> v sobě neobsahuje, a proto může doktorka Banksová v jedné filmové scéně ve svém památném heuréka momentu vyhrknout, že Heptapod B je “nelineární systém ortografie”. Nechápajícím přihlížejícím vysvětluje:</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LOUISE</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He [myslí se jeden z Heptapodů] starts at two opposite points and completes the sentence by joining them into a kind of loop. But to do this means he has to have the whole thing in his head before he begins. Every detail. The spacing has to be right or else you wind up with fragments; a mess. (beat) It’s more impressive than that. He wrote the mirror image of it. It’s reversed, so we can read it.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COLONEL WEBER</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So? They’re good at writing?</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LOUISE</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s a result of the way they </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">think</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s like they know everything they’re going to say before they say it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Předchozí konverzace nám odkrývá zásadní poznatek. Heptapodi jsou nějakým způsobem osvobozeni od lineární přímky času, což jim umožňuje jejich mysl různě v čase posouvat. Čas není pro ně jednosměrná silnice, ale spíše rozsáhlý prostor bez hranic, který vnímají zcela najednou a libovolně mohou “zoomovat” do jeho zvolených částí. Jazyk Heptapod B tak reflektuje unikátní kognitivní vlastnosti Heptapodů. Jak je něco takového reálného a co má vůbec jazyk společného s myšlením?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Příběh hlavní myšlenku, že jazyk ovlivňuje myšlení, čerpá ze známé kontroverzní lingvistické teorie, tzv. Whorf-Sapirovy hypotézy (WSH), která byla formulována výzkumníkem Sapirem v roce 1929 a následně rozpracována jeho studentem Whorfem (Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, Oxford English Dictionary). Jádro hypotézy říká, že jazyk (a především jeho gramatika) určitým způsobem ovlivňuje, jak rodilý mluvčí jazyka strukturují svět kolem sebe. Původní Whorfovy myšlenky mohou být shrnuty tak, že</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myšlení je zcela zřejmě závislé na jazyku</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gramatika (nikoli slovní zásoba) jazyka definuje vztah mezi myšlením a jazykem</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sapir již v roce 1928 ve svém článku </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Status of Linguistics as a Science</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> píše: “Je faktem, že ‘reálný svět’ je do velké míry postaven na jazykových zvycích dané skupiny. Žádné dva jazyky nejsou dostatečně podobné, abychom o nich řekli, že reprezentují stejnou sociální realitu.” Výše zmíněné lze interpretovat, že přestože překlad mezi jazyky je možný, protože slova jsou nahraditelná, nikdy nedosáhneme výsledku, který by během procesu neztrácel něco z původního originálu. Neboť podle této hypotézy je to právě gramatika, která mnohem hlouběji ovlivňuje myšlení. Gramatika je ale pro Whorfa i Sapira zcela produktem vývoje kultury dané skupiny lidí, čímž se jejich názory liší od novějších lingvistických teorií, na kterém pracoval např. Noam Chomsky, jehož koncept Universální gramatiky naopak tvrdí, že gramatika </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">je </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sdílena mezi kulturami, a to na té nejnižší, biologické úrovni mozku. Pro Chomskyho a jeho přívržence jde v jazyku v první řadě o gramatiku (syntax), která ve velmi abstraktní podobě je jednoduchým komputačním mechanismem, který se v mozku vyvinul procesem darwinovské evoluce. I když je WSH interpretována různě, na základě vlivu Worfa získala WSH formu, ze které lze usoudit její základní stavební kameny. Worf, inspirován Jungovou Gestaltpsychologií, rozlišuje dva druhy myšlení:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">izoláty zkušenosti</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">izoláty významu</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Izoláty zkušenosti jsou procesem segmentování reality, nikoli procesem myšlení; jedná se o proces nelingvistický, který je společný všem lidem a</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> je nezávislý na jazyce</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Lee, 1996, pp. 96–122; Whorf, 1939, pp. 163–64). Jinak řečeno, pokud leží na stole kladivo, podle Whorfa neplatí, že by gramatika jazyka ovlivnila myšlení dvou různých mluvčích tak, že by před sebou nespatřili stejný stůj a na něm ležet stejné kladivo. Na druhé straně izoláty významu “jsou koncepty v mysli mluvčího (myšlenky)”, které uchopují izoláty zkušenosti (a tedy externí fyzický svět) určitým, kulturně specifickým způsobem, aby mluvčí izolátům zkušenosti přidělil nějaké významy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ačkoli Ted Chiang v jednom z rozhovorů říká, že před napsáním své povídky byl ponořen pár let v odborné lingvistické literatuře, rozhodně nelze autorovi upřít uměleckou volnost, s jakou WSH zapracoval do svého příběhu. Myšlenka, že by lingvistický relativismus měl takovou moc, že by dokázal ovlivňovat rovnou fyzický svět, totiž samozřejmě v práci Whorfa, ani Sapira nenajdeme. Ba co více, Whorf viz výše říká, že gramatika nemá vliv na externí fyzický svět (izoláty zkušenosti).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To, že Chiang nezůstal věrný lingvistické teorie, mě až tak netrápí. Mnohem více jsem přemýšlel nad tím, jakým způsobem v příběhu vysvětluje cestování časem, kterým jsou mluvčí Heptapodu B obdařeni. Pokud se nemýlím a něco jsem nepřehlédl, celá zápletka — jak povídky, tak filmu — je vysvětlena a stojí na výše uvedené krátké citaci ze scénáře: Dr. Louise Banksová zde tvrdí, a teď parafrázuji, že psaní symbolů je velmi složité a že ještě před začátkem psaní musí mluvčí dopředu vědět každý podrobný detail toho, co přesně chce říct (nakreslit). Upřímně jsem čekal o něco sofistikovanější vysvětlení.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Je jasné, že něco takového průměrný člověk zvládne velmi těžko. I tak výborné lingvistce, jakou je Dr. Banksová, bude trvat několik let, než si skutečně plynule osvojí Heptapod B. Přesto netuším, proč rychlost, s jakou Heptapodi kreslí své symboly, mást přesvědčit čtenáře/diváka, že takový jazyk ovlivňuje nejen vnímání fyzického světa, ale porušuje námi známé fyzikální zákony. To, že lidstvo tyto zákony může v budoucnu objevit, není vyloučené, ale to není argument, který je použit ve filmu, kde skutečně jde pouze a právě o to, jak složitý a odlišný jazyk Heptapod B je.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mnohem ochotněji bych připustil, že Heptapod B je pro mimozemské rodilé mluvčí hračkou prostě proto, že jejich kognitivní schopnosti a jakýsi inteligenční kvocient zásadně přesahují i ty nejtalentovanější z lidského plémě. Vždyť si vzpomeňme, že o Johnu von Neumannovi, který vlastnil jednu z nejrychlejších myslí všech dob, se také říkalo, že je “z jiného světa”, že je “patří k novému lidskému druhu”.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byl jsem ale skutečně tak zklamaný z povídky i filmu, protože nedokážu zkousnout výše uvedené spekulování nad aspekty vědeckých teorií? Je jasné, že tomu tak není. Nechť je důkazem právě tento text. Ihned po skončení filmu a otřepání se z výborného audiovizuálního zážitku (co se soundtracku týče, je pravdou, že ani Arrival se nevyhnul již poměrně kýčovitému zvukovému efektu, který má dramatizovat určité scény, a který se objevuje snad v každém druhém traileru nových, převážně akčně laděných filmů) jsem se rozhodl, že budu chtít na film reagovat v psané podobě, abych si v klidu mohl sednout a promyslet mechaniku příběhu. Ten totiž patří k jedním z nejinspirativnějších a nejoriginálnějších, které jsem v poslední době viděl. Arrival za to samozřejmě vděčí původní povídce, jejíž autor se tímto dostal ze scifi undergroundu do filmového mainstreamu. A to je dobře.</span></p>\n<p>P.

Víra bylo jediné, co mi zbývalo, z jednoho prostého důvodu: jsem matematicko-statistický ignorant, a to i přesto, že se chystám dokončit magisterský kurz na nejstarší české univerzitě, a tak by se mohlo očekávat, že jako člen akademické obce a pomyslné intelektuální třídy budu pro budoucí život řádně vybaven i těmito znalostmi. Bohužel tomu tak není. A neviním z toho nikoho jiného než sebe. O svém nedostatečném matematickém vzdělání jsem přemýšlel již několikrát a mnohem dříve, ale jsou to právě prezidentské volby v USA, respektive jejich výsledek, které mě nutí se zamyslet nad tím, co v dnešní době znamená být intelektuálem a pseudointelektuálem, vzdělancem a nevzdělancem</span><b>.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Současný obor, který studuji, mi kromě jiného ukázal relevantní literaturu, ze které je pod rouškou velkých slov a dlouhých vět zjevné, jak technologie a technické myšlení dominuje současným světem. Přestože během každodenních činností si toho příliš nevšimneme, většina práce, vývoje a výzkumů, které mají největší prakticky dopad na společnost, jsou ve svém jádru výsledkem technického myšlení, či konkrétněji výsledkem založeným na teorii, jejíž nejpřesnější vyjádření má matematickou podobu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A to platí i pro současné humanitní vědy, které se neochotně připravují již delší dobu na to, že verbální schopnosti nebudou budoucím akademikům stačit: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">špatný výzkum v humanitních vědách nahrazuje dobrá statistická analýza, kdežto dobrý humanitní výzkum se bez algoritmizované analýzy jen tak neobejde</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Může se zdát, že například pro studium literatury není potřeba mít technicko-matematické vzdělání, ba naopak, lidé často studují literaturu právě proto, že toto vzdělání nemají a nechtějí mít. Tahle domněnka platí. Zisk titulu v tomto oboru nevyžaduje, aby student byl vybaven znalostmi programování, ale pokud se člověk chce vydat na profesionální kariéru literárního vědce, pak situace není tak samozřejmá. Naopak, v posledních letech se ukazuje, že využití sofistikovaných datových analýz přináší skutečně nové vědecké poznatky. Například nedávno jsme se mohli dočíst, že počítačová analýza stylu Shakespearových divadelních her připsala spoluautorství hry Jindřich VI odvěkému konkurentovi barda ze Stradfordu, Christopheru Marlowe, který byl již dlouhou dobu považován za jednoho z kandidátů v alternativních teorií autorství Shakespearova díla. Počítačová analýza sice vyvrátila, že by Marlowe byl samotný Shakespeare (či naopak, pokud chcete), ale uznané spoluautorství jednoho z nejzásadnějších děl tradičního Západního kánonu není bezvýznamné. A to jak pro Marlowa, tak i pro budoucí vztah humanitních věd a počítačových metod, kterému se v akademických kruzích říká, poněkud vágně, Digital Humanities. Tento vztah ale potvrzuje již řečené: výkon počítačů a chytrý software mění i doplňuje zavedené metody (nejen) v humanitních vědách, zároveň stále platí, že nové algoritmizované metody jsou úspěšné tehdy, když jsou doprovázeny kvalitním, co nejvíce objektivním a precizním klasickým výzkumem. Jedno bez druhého nejde. Aspoň do té doby než umělá inteligence bude vykazovat kreativní výsledky, jež budou srovnatelné s těmi lidskými. Zdali se tomu tak někdy stane, není jisté. Zatím počítače vědcům slouží jen jako kognitivní protéza, lidský prvek je stále v mnoha případech nepostradatelný.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Protože se na svět více (v sociálních a humanitních vědách) či méně (ve vědách tvrdých) díváme z pozice lidského pozorovatele, musíme počítat s tím, že sociální svět se nám bude vždy ukazovat prostřednictvím našich lidských chyb, kognitivních zkreslení, ideologií, předsudků a nedostatku znalostí. Často hovoříme o tom, že nevzdělaný člověk je více náchylný k názorům, které jsou založené na emocích, a vůbec ke sklonům k iracionálnímu uvažování. Jenže problém je i na druhé straně. Čím více je člověk vzdělaný, tím více jsou jeho život i kariéra zainvestované v konkrétní, nutno říci úzké části názorů na svět. Kde “nevzdělanec” pouze spekuluje se svými kupány u večerního piva a ráno jde do práce, která nemá s politikou nic společného, tam “vzdělanec” brání hodnoty, kterým věnuje celý svůj profesionální, často i soukromý život, protože musí. Jak by mohl podlamovat hodnoty, které mu zajišťují přísun financí a společenské prestiže, nehledě na to, že většina jeho sociálních kontaktů se skládá z lidí jako je on sám? Z toho pro mě vyplývá, že vzdělanec může paradoxně být mnohem náchylnější ke zkratkovitému a emocionálnímu uvažování, protože narozdíl od toho nevzdělance, který se maximálně ztrapní mezi přáteli u piva, tak vzdělanci se v případě, kdy vyjde najevo, že se celou dobu mýlil, bortí život. Mýlit se pro něj znamená existenciální ohrožení. Proto zastánci stalinismu, maoismu, behaviorismu a jiných veskrze nevědeckých teorií bránili tyto myšlenky do posledních minut, a to i potom, co bylo zřejmé, jaká zvěrstva na lidech a myslích napáchaly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takže jsou tu intelektuálové, u kterých lze zvláště očekávat dogmatické lpění na jejich názorech. Bohužel pro nás, studenty oficiální a věčné, jsou to právě oni, ke kterým až s příliš velkou důvěrou vzhlížíme jako k totemům pravého a nezkresleného poznání. Ale nemusí tomu tak být, pokud jsme schopni sami posoudit, jestli jejich myšlenky stojí za to, abychom jim věnovali čas. K tomu ale student potřebuje mít nějaké již existující znalosti, na základě kterých nové znalosti hodnotí. Znalosti obecně získáváme prostřednictvím vlastních zážitků, intuice, spirituálního prozření a v neposlední řadě, ano, hádáte správně, opět od již zmíněných intelektuálů. A třebaže se najdou tací, kteří dokáží v temném koutě svého pokoje, bez přísunu cizích myšlenek, odvodit matematické rovnice, pochopit Marxismus, napsat Shakespearovy sonety, nebo sestavit malý jaderný reaktor, většina z nás si vezme do ruky knihu a bude řádek po řádku vstřebávat předžvýkané myšlenky někoho jiného, jen aby je pak mohla reprodukovat za své, ať už s citací pod poznámkovou čarou, nebo bez ní. Zdá se, že pokud se chceme vyhnout nekritickému přijmání myšlenek jednoho intelektuála, musíme přijmou myšlenky intelektuála druhého! Je to začarovaný kruh, jemuž se jen tak nevyhneme. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co můžeme udělat, je smířit se s tím, že většina znalostí, které známe, jsou prostě špatně, či přinejmenším, jak říkával můj vyučující na informatiku, nepravdami. Nová pravda se rodí na okrajích hlavního proudu současného poznání, nikdy v jejím středu, který převážně slouží jako kustod statusu quo, tedy obecně přijímaných pravd ve společnosti, ke kterým se intelekuálové obracejí jako ke “konsensu”, a lidé, kteří nemají ani páru o tom, co tyto dočasné pravdy vlastně znamenají (tzn. novináři, spisovatelé, političní komentátoři = verbální lidé bez matematicko-statistického vzdělání), jako k tomu, “co říkají odborníci”. Ale nezoufejme, stejným procesem dohmatávání pravdy prošlo mnoho lidí před námi, a přece dosáhli určitého nového poznání.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pravdy a objektivity v nejbližší době nedosáhneme — naše mozky k tomu rozhodně nebyly určeny a je trochu náhodou a zázrakem, že ta želatinová hmota, která dříve sloužila k lovení mamutů a sbírání lesních plodů, nyní dokáže spočítat, kdy byl počátek vesmíru — ale můžeme se k nim přiblížit pomalou a pečlivou činností střádání informací, třídění a porovnávání faktů, ke kterým postupně přidáváme vlastní myšlenky. Většinu času se budeme pohybovat ve stínech, ale občas na periferii našeho myšlení zachytíme světlo informací majících nějaký vztah k pravdě. Stejně jako v humanitních vědách, tato činnost bylo do nedávna relativně uspěšným postupem toho, co označujeme obecně za vzdělávání. Stejně jako v humanitních vědách, mnoho užitečných informací bylo možné vstřebat pouze verbální cestou. A ze stejného důvodu jako v humanitních vědách je tato cesta dnes nedostačující.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Po vyhlášení výsledků voleb a ohlášení jejich vítěze jsem se cítil podveden. Nikoli vítězným či poraženým kandidátem, ale sebou samým. Pod tlakem expertních posudků a interpretací výzkumů jsem se nechal přesvědčit, že kandidátka na prezidentský post, Hillary Clintonová, má více než 80% šanci v těchto volbách zvítězit. K mé obhajobě jsem nebyl jediný, kdo podlehl tomuto “konsensu” a zároveň jsem byl jeden z mnoha lidí, kteří neměli potřebné znalosti k tomu, aby si aspoň ověřili metody, kterými tento konsensus vlastně vznikl. Cítil jsem se </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funkčně negramotným</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tahle myšlenka není až tak přetažená za vlasy. Text, jakožto médium myšlení, slouží více a více pouze k popularizaci, skutečné jádro vědění je zakódováno v matematické formě. To ostatně psal Vilém Flusser ve své eseji </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alfanumerická společnost</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, ve které popisuje, jak text a tradiční verbální gramotnost, dříve výhradou vzdělanců a knežstva, se díky demokratizaci vzdělání rozšířila; nyní ale alfanumerická společnost je řízena novým knežstvem, jež ovládá jazyk matematiky (a troufnu si dodat obecný jazyk algoritmizovaného myšlení a programování). Neznamená to, že intelektuálové včerejška jako je např. americký novinář Malcom Gladwell hned vymizí. Funkce popularizátorů vědeckých poznatků bude pro laickou veřejnost nabývat na důležitosti, protože více a více veřejnosti bude (pokud se současný trend nezmění) funkčně či zcela matematicky negramotná. Pro nové intelektuály, strážce vědění, pro matematicky smýšlející osoby bude Gladwell možná zbytečný, nebo dokonce kontraproduktivní, protože bude ve společnosti rozsévat spoustu nepravd a lží.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Znamená to, že každý, kdo se chce dnes považovat za vzdělaného člověka, musí nutně studovat matematiku? Je zcela očividné, že v praxi tomu tak být nemusí a není. Jestliže ale cílem intelektuála je pravda (jakkoli naivně tohle slovo v postmoderní společnosti zní), matematicko-statistické myšlení rozhodně je vhodným nástrojem, jak se k pravdě přiblížit. To ostatně chápe i epicentrum veškerého intelektuálství, tedy univerzity, když začaly přijímat matematiku do tradičně verbálních disciplín. Již jsem zmínil Digital Humanities, což je nejnovější příspěvěk zapojení matematiky do humanitních věd, podobné revoluce bylo možné zaznamenat v matematizaci ekonomie, sociologie a nedávno i historie a teologie, když akademik a historik Richard Carrier použil bayesovskou statistiku pro přehodnocení faktů ve studiích raného křesťanství a existence Ježíše Krista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matematizace myšlení ale není bez nebezpečných zákoutí. Snad až na matematiku samotnou, kde lze v rámci nějakého axiomatického systému jednoznačně prokázat, že daná exprese je pravdivá; nebo ve fyzice, kde teoretické poznatky s potřebnou technikou je možno ověřit experimentem, je všude jinde potřeba do rovnic přidat nějaké své hypotézy, a tím také veškerou tu lidskou bagáž v podobě ideologií a kognitivních zkreslení. Dostáváme se tak do opačného extrému: matematika “bez hodin sociologie, historie, kulturní antropologie, etnologie či filosofie” může sloužit nejen k ideologické propagandě, ale také k destruktivním politicko-ekonomickým agendám. V listopadových Literárních novinách uvádí Michal Rubáš ve svém sloupku</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> O ne-užitečnosti matematiky</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> jeden z mnoha příkladů: V německé ekonomice se vypočítá, že “v následujících letech [bude] zapotřebí nahradit úbytek vymírající domácí pracovní síly pracovníky z ciziny a mezi obě proměnné napíší ‘rovná se’. [&#8230;] Kdyby manažeři průmyslu vystudovali něco jiného než ekonomiku nebo matematiku, dozvěděli by se, že i když jsou mnohé objekty označitelné stejnými či podobnými znaky, nezískají tím vlastnosti znaků ani se sobě navzájem nezačnou více podobat”. (Literární noviny, 11/2016, s. 2) Ano i královnu věd, matematiku, je možné naroubovat na ideologii, zvláště když abstrahování veškerých skutečných vlastností objektů rovnic tak náramně zjednodušuje výpočty, kde rodilého a vzdělaného Němce je možné vyměnit za člověka bez zanlosti tamního jazyka, kultury, společnosti, člověk bez zázemí a životní jistoty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co z toho všeho vyplývá? Verbální tlachání, bez logického uvažování a potřebných schopností získat a strojově interpretovat Velká data; tlachání, které se ve své argumentaci zaměřuje na emoce čtenáře, je stejně toxické jako puritánské matematické modely technických fachidiotů. Jeden má diplom z rétoriky a anglické literatury, druhý z algebraické topologie. Tyto protipóly se v amerických prezidentských volbách potkaly, a to za účelem jednomyslně dosadit do prezidentského křesla první ženu, demokratku, matku všech sociálních vojáků a hodnou babičku zlých vlků z Wall Street.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funkčně negramotní ve statistice a matematice se jen mohli dívat na pěknou infografiku, která se tváří podobně svůdně jako dlouhá esej v New York Times plná citací literárních děl. Oba výstupy, redukující komplexní data o mnoha proměnných na stravitelný výstup pro matematicky negramotnou humanistickou většinu, fungují jako </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">meme</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, který se (zne)užívá ve společnosti pro argumentaci, zastrašování politických oponentů a dezinformaci. Matematicky negramotná humanistická většina se nechala strhnout pro ně nicneříkajícími čísly. Novináři, političní “punditi”, komentátoři rozšiřovali a recyklovali tento meme, který pro ně byl černou skříňkou, epistemologickým fast foodem, protože jejich vzdělání (a často i inteligence) nic numerického nestráví. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citím, že jsem byl jedním z nich. Ne proto, že bych vědomě šířil jejich ideologii, ale proto, že jsem nemohl přijít s matematicko-statistickými protiargumenty, které by vyjádřily můj nesouhlas s tím, jak mainstreamová média interpretují (americký) svět. Bez hlubšího porozumění, odkud se data berou a jak se s nimi zachází, se smrskla má role, pro některé jako role intelektuála, na elegantní citování výzkumů, které mě vedly k určitému přesvědčení. Vše špatně. Narazil jsem jako většina. Když padla veškeré iluze toho, že je možné outsourcovat své rozhodování na nekompetentní mediální ikony, co dál?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V první řadě je třeba zůstat při zemi a ze začátku říct, že je nereálné, aby každý </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">skutečný intelektuál informační doby</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> dennodenně stahoval nová data, která bude přes noc na svém počítači analyzovat, jen aby se vše příští den vše změnilo a mohl začít od začátku. Sofistikovanější algoritmy, přístupné veřejnosti, mohou určitě leccos zjednodušit, ale vedle takového řešení je můj návrh mnohem prozaičtější: skutečný intelektuál informační doby by měl být schopen vzít surovou kolekci dat a aplikovat na ni analýzu dle matematických metod, ale i hypotéz, jež </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sám</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> volí a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sám</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> dokáže své hypotézy aplikovat na statistický model. Jestli bude výsledná analýza mít něco společného s realitou, to už bude záležet na tom, jaké hypotézy člověk podle svého chápání světa preferuje. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navrhuji tak, aby všichni, kdo se považují za intelektuály, analytiky, a jiné veřejné funkce mluvící k lidu, šli s kůží na trh: ukažte nám svá data, ze kterých vycházíte; popište nám metodologii a hypotézy, kterými data interpretujete; nakonec všechny tyto údaje přiložte ke svému článku nebo je zveřejněte na svém veřejném profilu typu GitHub. Argumentujte (s) daty. Slovo totiž není ideální nástroj na pojmutí dynamických komplexních systémů. Dost bylo verbální rétoriky alá New York Times. Každý vysokoškolák musí být schopný si data a popis metodologie stáhnout a prohnat vlastními programy. Je-li vysoká škola přípravou na život, numerická kompetence a obratnost s daty jsou novodobou latinou, je to lingua franca vzdělanců. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jestliže někdo touží po klidu a štěstí, ať má víru v druhé, přestože hrozí, že bude papouškovat předžvýkanou stravu. Takový člověk, třeba i vysokoškolák, bude levnou reklamou a užitečným idiotem všech ideologů. Chce-li ale být učedníkem pravdy, pak ať zkoumá v univerzu dat.</span></p>\n<p><em>(Chyby, překlepy a dotazy pište na hello(at)jakubferenc.cz)</em></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>V téhle eseji se snažím okomentovat svou frustraci nad tím, jak má matematická nevzdělanost způsobila, že jsem během volebního šílenství byl odkázán na média, aby mi interpretovala data a řekla, jak se to s volbami má.

Dříve to byla televize, video, dnes se (také vedle hudby) glitch umělci a teoretici zabývají objekty ovlivěné digitálním kódem, algoritmizací, programovacími jazyky, jinak řečeno celým ekosystémem moderních počítačů.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Důležitou charakteristikou “glitche” v systému, ať už hardwarovém či softwarovém, je fakt, že se jedná o deviaci od hladkého chodu, jejíž výsledek nelze dopředu odhadnout (Fuller, 110). Zvláště v kontextu softwaru se glitchem rozumí nikoli syntaktické a logické chyby programu, ale momentální technický problém, který může být k běhu programu externím: například chvilkovým snížením přenosové rychlosti internetového přenosu nebo zapisovací rychlosti pevného disku. Hráči online počítačových her si vybaví pojem “lag”, který označuje např. chaotické chování hráčovy postavy, projevující se jako “zmražení” nebo poskakování v prostoru virtuálního světa, bez renderování mezikroků.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glitch je zjednodušeně chybou. Nemusíme ji dále kvalifikovat, abychom mohli říct, že jakmile se Glitch v softwarovém systému objeví, hladký chod je přerušen, systém nereaguje tak, jak předpokládal nejen uživatel, ale také designér. Označíme-li předem navržené, plánované chování systému, ale i všechny neplánovaná chování, které nicméně jsou ve výsledku pro uživatele hodnotné, neboť uspokojují jeho cíle, jako A, pak Glitch je něco, co stojí mimo A, jako negace A, NON(A).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tato aritmetika jednoznačně privileguje utilitárnost a zaměřuje se na softwarový systém jako nástroj, který je tvůrcem navržen, aby poskytoval co nejpřívětivější funkcionality, které rychle a bezproblematicky navádí uživatele k plnění jeho potřeb. Přístup ke tvorbě softwaru, kde elementární jednotkou filosofie designu je “potřeba” nebo “cíl”, není jediný používaný, naopak za posledních 40 let bylo možné ve tvorbě softwaru vidět několik teorií a metod, jak software navrhovat. Mezi nejznámější patří </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">participační design</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">goal-oriented design</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">human-centred design</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">teorie aktivit</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fenomenologický přístup</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, nebo v posledních dvou dekádách důraz na uživatelské zážitky (user experience) a holistický přístup k navrhování softwaru i obecněji technologie, kdy designér bere v potaz nejen situační kontext interakce člověk-stroj, ale také šiřší kontext prostředí, ve kterém interakce probíhá, což ve výsledku vede k pojetí softwaru jako digitálních artefaktů, jež participují na společensko-kulturních procesech. Výše zmíněné přístupy studuje podrobně akademický obor HCI či konkrétněji interakční design. V literatuře těchto oborů se ale nedočteme o Glitchi jako konceptu, který by ovlivňoval diskurz human-computer interaction. Naopak, pokud se technická literatura vůbec o Glitchi zmíní, je to “glitch” s malým “g”, chyby, kterým je nutné se při návrhu vyvarovat. Otázkou je, co má Glitch společného se softwarem, nebo dokonce návrhem uživatelského rozhraní?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glitche jsou pro umělce i teoretiky zajímavé tím, že zpřístupňují uživateli-divákovi části systému, které neměly být vidět; odkrývají interní mechanismy, které jsou běžně před zrakem uživatele skryté. Glitche v přehrávání videa mohou odkrývat jinak neviditelné kroky kompresních algoritmů, glitch ve webových stránkách pak třeba uživateli zobrazí systémové popup okno, tzv. “alert”, kde kromě generického chybového hlášení se může objevit zvýrazněná pozice v kódu, signalizující, kde program přestal pracovat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jelikož samotný kód programu je dnes zpravidla vždy skryt před uživatelem za grafickým uživatelským rozhraním (GUI), glitch se materializuje právě jako vizuální artefakt. Jeho podoba může být esteticky dostatečně zajímavá na to, aby umělci v počátku náhodný úkaz začali formalizovat algoritmem, a následně jej využívat jako materiál a uměleckou paletu. Tato evoluce od ojedinělé chyby systému po řízenou náhodu si žádala, aby druhy glitche bylo možné přesně pojmenovat a odlišit. Proto mluvíme o prvních z nich jako o “pure glitch”, zatímco glitch, napodobený pro estetické potřeby, je označován jako “glitch alike”.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teoretici Olga Goriunova a Alexei Shulgin poznamenávají, že Glitch představuje </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">skutečnou, autentickou estetiku počítače a softwaru</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Argumentují, že estetika softwaru vždy adoptovala elementy a konvence z jiných sfér a médií: všudypřítomná metafora pracovní desky stolu (desktop), nebo i starší paradigma human-computer interakce, příkazová řádka, se inspiruje u starších technologií jako telegraf. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Argument Goriunové a Shulgina vychází z “negativní” definice autentické softwarové estetiky: teprve když něco nefunguje, ukazuje počítač a software svou pravou povahu. Jelikož počítač je technologie,  existující v širším socio-kulturním kontextu, který definuje, jaký vztah lidé k počítači mají, historicky víme, že většina populace se o počítače začala zajímat teprve tehdy, když jednak počítače pro ně byly finančně dostupné, a zároveň když pro ně nabízely určitou utilitární hodnotu, tedy už na začátku textu zmíněné plnění uživatelských cílů a tužeb. Počítače se staly součástí společnosti bez toho, aniž by uživatelé věděli, jak počítač funguje. I v dnešní době je pro většinu lidí počítač černou skřínkou, jejíž obsah zprostředkovává většinou grafické uživatelské rozhraní. Je to GUI, které je styčnou plochou mezi strojem a společností (Brejcha). Pokud tedy hledáme povahu počítače a jeho autentickou estetiku, která je sociálním konstruktem, musíme ji dle mého názoru hledat právě “na rozhraní” (jež nemusí být pouze grafické, viz například popularita NUI &#8211; natural user interface). Tam bychom měli hledat onu autentickou estetiku, protože zde se autentická povaha počítače a softwaru formuje. Estetika sofwaru = estetika (G)UI.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(2) Jistě lze souhlasit s Goriunovou a Shulginem, že tvorba GUI pokračuje v konceptu re-mediace, definovanou Grusinen a Bolterem v jejich knize </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remediation: understanding new media</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, kde GUI využívá metafory, idiomy předchozích médií. Každé médium nakonec re-mediuje, využívá médií již existujících, proto nařknout designéry softwaru, že jejich výtvory, které re-mediují a absorbují existující metafory a prvky především z reálného světa, produkují ne-autentickou estetiku, znamená říct, že </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">žádná </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tvorba a design softwaru nemůže splňovat jejich požadavek na autenticitu. A to z jednoho prostého důvodu: jen Bůh tvoří </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ex nihilo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Nová řešení staví na existujícím.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jan Michl, teoretik designu, tento vztah pak popisuje jako „pupeční šňůru“, kterou jsou výsledky soustavného, systematického a cíleného bádání propojeny s minulostí, přítomností a budoucností. Slovy filosofa vědy Karla Poppera: „[…] kdyby chtěl někdo začít od Adama, dál než Adam by se nedostal…“ (Popper). Jan Michl, jako zastánce realistického designu, totiž vidí design jako </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">redesign</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Michl tvrdí, že každý funkční kompletní výrobek, jako výstup designérské činnosti, není tvořen ex nihilo, ale je nevyhnutelně „výsledkem redesignu, tzn. rezultátem práce mnoha designérů, respektive postupného drobného i radikálního vylepšování předchozích řešení, přičemž žádný z jednotlivých účastníků tohoto procesu není s to předvídat ani plánovat komplexnost řešení pozdějších“ (Michl, s. 24). Michl dodává, že znalost takových precedentních řešení, ať už vlastních nebo cizích, odlišuje zkušeného designéra od začátečníka (Ferenc, s. 47).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proto výpůjčky, kopírování, re-mixování, syntetizující montáž apod. nelze a priori hodnotit jako ne-autentické nebo nekreativní. Problémem není použití těchto metod, ale otázka, kdy kvantitativní změny vedou ke změnám kvalitatitivním. To není jednoduchý úkol a odpovědi mohou často být arbitrární, protože evoluční změny mají spíše charakter spojít, nežli diskrétní, nicméně budou se lišit od hledání autentické estetiku Goriunové a Shulgina v jednom důležitém bodě: namísto definice estetiky negativně, lze autentickou estetiku definovat </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pozitivně</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Myslím tím estetiku vycházející z existující podoby softwarového designu, z existujících řešení designérů. Je to hodnocení estetiky softwaru založené na tom, co velká většina uživatelů softwaru prožívá, co formuje společenské myšlení o softwarovém designu a z čeho softwaroví designéři čerpají pro své nové a nadcházející projekty. Glitch čerpá z toho, co nefunguje, pozitivní estetika softwaru z to, co </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funguje</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(3) Designéři softwaru si v poslední dekádě uvědomili, že přenášení metafor z fyzického světa do kontextu softwaru značně a zbytečně ovlivňuje chování digitálních produktů. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teoretik médii Steven Holtzmann si limitace příliš věrného napodobování ne-digitálních objektů v digitálním světě všímá:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Koneckonců, ať jsou tyto postupy (předělávky) jakkoli zajímavé, příjemné, pohodlné či nadšeně přijímané, stojí na výpujčkách z existujících paradigmat. Nebyly vytvořeny s ohledem na digitální média, a v důsledku toto nevyužívají specifického a jedinečného potenciálu digitálních světů…” (Holtzmann, s. 15)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Po úspěchu americké firmy Apple s jejich aplikováním designové filosofie skeumorfismu, jež hlásila, že pro uživatelskou přívětivost a použitelnost je důležité, aby uživatelé mohli využít již naučených vzorců chování, které běžně používají ve fyzickém světě — terminologií teorie designu, aby co nejrychleji objevili “afordance”, které produkt poskytuje — bylo nevyhnutelné, že i další firmy chtěly následovat stejné, nutno říci úspěšné strategie. Jenže softwarový vývoj šel dopředu ruku v ruce s nově dostupným hardwarem. Řady dostupných zařízení variabilních rozměrů a možností po tvůrcích softwaru vyžadovaly buďto úpravu kódu pro každé zařízení zvlášť, nebo změnu přístupu ke tvorbě tak, aby jeden kód byl funkční na co nejvíce zařízeních. Software se musel </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">adaptovat</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> na hardware, být </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">responzivním</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Zpočátku tomuto problému čelili nejdříve tvůrci webových stránek, s nástupem mobilních, smart zařízeních ale narazili na stejný problém i tvůrci nativních aplikací. Řešením bylo odpoutat se od odzkoušené, ale limitující teoreticko-estetického skeumorfismu, který pro simulaci vzhledu a textur přírodních materiálů využíval detailní bitmapové grafiky. Ta ze své podstaty fixního rastru pixelů není vhodná pro tvorbu softwaru, který se má přizpůsobovat různým velikostem obrazovky.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S první propracovanou alternativou ke stárnoucímu skeumorfismu přišla až společnost Microsoft, která pro novou verzi svého mobilního operačního systému vytvořila designový jazyk, původně nazvaný Metro, který s využitím typografie, fotografií a animovaných interakcí přinesl “autenticky digitální” zážitky a který “překračuje pravidla a vlastnosti fyzického světa, aby vytvářel nové a poutavé možnosti v čistě digitálním světě” (Modern design at Microsoft: Going beyond flat design</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Designéři Microsoftu se přímo inspirovali “mezinárodním typografickým stylem”, tedy modernistickým grafickým designem z první poloviny 20. století ovlivněným praxí ve Švýcarsku, Německu, Nizozemí a Rusku.  Autenticita, kterou Microsoft proklamoval, nebyla pouze reklamním sloganem. Designéři tohoto amerického giganta si byli vědomi, že tvoří opravdu něco nového. Vzdali se cíleně většiny do té doby používaných metafor a idiomů uživatelského rozhraní softwaru, odmítli čerpat z fyzického světa a jeho afordancí. Celé UI zploštili, upozadili nepotřebné grafické prvky rozhraní (v angličtině chrome), což mělo za následek, že do popředí se dostal samotný obsah: text, fotografie, videa, zvuk apod. Metro design se objevil právě ve chvíli, kdy komunita softwarových designérů řešila problémy, vycházející z rigidnosti bitmapové grafiky. Metro design, či “flat” design, což je pojmenování designového stylu vycházejícího z Metra, využívají vektorové grafiky, jež je zcela matematicky popsatelná, a proto libovolně škálovatelná. Ideální vlastnost, pokud nevíme, na jakém zařízení výsledný softwarový design bude zobrazen. Příchod Metro designu značí skutečný průlom v estetice softwaru. Jeho matematický základ je mnohem blíže softwaru a kultuře počítače. Je “digital-native”. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kromě matematizace Metro oznamuje i další trend: touha pro transparentnosti. Každé uživatelské rozhraní zprostředkovává. Když ve fyzickém světě chceme zvednout knihu ze stolu, neklikáme na nabídku START a nevybíráme příslušný příkaz z menu. Jednoduše tak učiníme. Softwaroví designéři si sice uvědomili, že grafická imitace světa je omezují a pro digitální svět nevhodná, přesto chápali, že čím méně člověk-uživatel bude muset klikat, aby se dostal k požadovanému cíli, tím bude uživatelské rozhraní funkčnějším. Jinak řečeno, čím méně UI, tím lépe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I proto se v posledních letech, i díky existujícímu hardwaru, objevují uživatelské rozhraní, které umožňují uživateli manipulovat s daty rychleji, přirozenějí, nezprostředkovaně. Tento styl tvorby softwarovému designu se nazývá NUI — Natural user interface. Je to další evoluční stupeň: od command-line interface (CLI), přes GUI (graphical user interface), až k NUI.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V současné době NUI myslíme především multi-dotykové zařízení, ale i nové typy ovládání u herních konzolí, kdy samotný pohyb hráče je překládán do příkazů ve hře. Zajímavým historickým příspěvkem, který se kriticky stavil k dominantnímu paradigmatu zobrazování dat během prohlížení internetu, byl alternativní webový prohlížeč </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">netomat</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Jeho autor Maciej Wisniewski navrhl prohlížeč, který data z internetu nezobrazoval v tradičním obdélníkovém okně se všemi běžnými prvky, které známe dodnes, namísto toho netomat, který neměl žádné fixní GUI, data jednoduše ve virtuálním prostoru zobrazoval jako poletující objekty. Síla a hlavně estetika konceptu byla znásobena na výstavě Data Dynamics v americkém Whitney muzeu, kde poletující datové objekty z netomatu byly promítány na stěnách galerijní místnosti. Uživatelské rozhraní, softwarovy design byl odstraněn. Co zbylo byl imerzivní zážitek a “intimní” propojení s digitálními daty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolter a Grusin si touze po transparentnosti UI všímají:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Designéři často říkají, že chtějí vytvořit “interface bez interface”, v jakém nebudou žádné rozpoznatelné elektronické nástroje — žádná tlačítka, okna, rolovací lišty ani ikony jako takové. Místo toho se bude uživatel pohybovat prostorem a interagovat s předměty “přirozeně”, tak jako v reálném světě.” (Dvořák, s. 72)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Docházíme k překvapivému závěru. Podle současného směřování softwarového designu i některých teoretickýh textů se zdá, že pozitivní estetikou softwaru je fluidnost, transparentnost, minimalizace GUI prvků, tedy ideálem uživatelského rozhraní je paradoxně jeho kompletní odstranění.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ačkoli by se nabízelo říct, že autentickou estetikou softwarového designu je skutečně zaměření na “interface bez interface”, bylo by to nepřesné tvrzení, neboť by přehlíželo důležité analytické rozdělení, které Goriunová se Shulginem také opomněli: software se dělí na kód a rozhraní, a zatímco kód může existovat bez rozhraní, opačně tomu tak není. To znamená, že kód jako materiál nemá inherentní podobu. Stejně jako materiál řekněme pro výrobu varné konvice. Atomy kovu a plastu neutvářejí inherentně nějaký tvar objektů, jsou pouze jednou ze čtyř Aristotelových příčin vzniku objektů: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">causa materialis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Je to až </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">causa efficiens</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, například řemeslník nebo designér, kdo dává objektu a materiálu formu. Účelů pro vznik formy, a tím pádem také estetiky této formy, se různí. Zde tkví pochybení zmíněných teoretiků Glitche: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chápali software především jako materiál pro digitální umělecké objekty, ale již ne software jako design</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To je vede k tomu, že dosavadní úspěšné interakční prvky pro návrh GUI jsou podle nich pro autentickou estetiku softwaru nedostačující, píší: “považujeme dynamické menu, [..], přímou manipulaci objektů na obrazovce, tlačítka, systémové zvuky, modely interakcí člověk-počítač” za nedostatečně bohaté. (Fuller, s. 112) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Přestože v historii tvorby softwaru existovaly tendence, kdy se “bohatost interakcí” považovala za nekriticky žádoucí, například užití technologie Flash na webové platformě, současný softwarový design je i pod vlivem kritičtějšího a teoreticky informovanějšího přístupu více minimalistický. Není tomu tak, že by designéři slepě následovali pouze funkčnost, to lze odmítnout jejich vzrůstajícím zájmem o </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uživatelské zážitky</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">potěšení</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> z užívání softwarových systémů, tedy ani se nemůže jednat o jakýsi “inženýrsko-racionální diktát” estetiky softwaru, po kterém naopak modernisté první poloviny 20. století jako umělec Van Doesburg či architekt Le Corbusier skutečně volali: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">„Naše epocha je proti jakékoli subjektivní spekulaci v umění, vědě, technologii atd. […] k tomu, abychom mohli vytvářet nové objekty, potřebujeme novou metodu, jinými slovy, objektivní systém” (Van Doesburg, Van Eesteren)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dům je „stroj pro živobytí“, který je navržen pomocí objektivního designu (Cross)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Metro design, flat design jsou reakcí na komplexnější změny role technologie ve společnosti: vzrůstající počet chytrých zařízení, které obsahují nějakou formu GUI; zařízení, které uživatelé používají mimo standardní prostory domova, a tudíž vzniká nárok (ale i příležitost) na to, aby designéři zohledňovali pozici, prostor, čas pro vzhled i funkce softwaru. Ekonomicky, technicky ani vizuálně není udržitelné navrhovat pro každý typ zařízení jiné GUI. Proto hovoříme o tom, že současný software je adaptivní, responsivní a reaguje na kontext. Navrhovat pro současný sofwarový svět znamená chápat, že estetika návrhu musí být uživatelům pomocníkem, partnerem. Nedokážu si představit, že by Glitch byl vizuální jazyk a strategie, jak navrhovat software pro chvíle, kdy mi v dopravní zácpě na hlavní avenue dojde benzín a já potřebuji co nejrychleji na smartphonu najít nejbližší nemocnici, protože mi partnerka na zadním sedadle právě začala rodit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jedná se o příliš instrumentální pohled na software? Je to pohled z opačné strany, než ze které pojímali software Goriunova a Shulgin. Pohled, který nicméně opomenuli a jehož zahrnutí do diskuze k estetice softwaru poněkud otevírá oči: vezmeme-li si na ukázku dříve zmíněný obraz varné konvice, tak je zřejmé, že nefunkční, děravá, tekoucí, elektřinu probíjející a neohřívající varná konvice je zajímavým objektem pro techno-umělecké bádání; pokud přijdeme unavení z práce a chceme šálek kávy, “zglitchovaná” konvice bude pravděpodobně poslední věc, co bychom si přáli.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ve svém textu jsem nabídl zkoumání estetiky softwaru jako estetiku současného softwarového designu. Ta je momentálně adaptivní, responsivní, kontextuální a minimalistická. Je to pohled, jenž se snaží o překonání negativního pohledu na software, tak jak jej definovali ve svém příspěvku teoretici Olga Goriunova a Alexei Shulgin, a který nabízí pohled na estetiku softwaru, když “dělá, co má dělat”. Odmítám, že by Glitch odkrýval něco na softwaru zásadně autentického. Pro software jako design to rozhodně neplatí a třebaže souhlasím, že Glitch se nabízí jako paleta pro novomediální umělce, pokud má být nějaká estetika sofwaru opravdu autentická, musí být bytostně přítomna u softwaru jako designu i u softwaru jako umění. Pokud ji nacházíme jen u jednoho pohledu, její nárok na univerzalitu se vytrácí. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Můj pohled je konzervativní. Neznamená to, že si nedokážu představit situaci, kdy Glitch by skutečně mohl odkrývat něco univerzálně autentického: pokud nepředpokládaná chyba systému povede k tomu, že software začne projevovat náznaky vědomí, nebude Glitch pouze autenticitou estetickou, ale i ontologickou. O tom více přibližně za 25-30 let.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BOLTER, Jay David a Richard GRUSIN. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remediation: understanding new media</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Wolfram je ale také plodný vědec, který ve třinácti si psal učebnice částicové fyziky a na jeho poměry relativně pozdě, tedy ve dvaceti, získal doktorát z teoretické fyziky. Tyto biografické údaje je důležité vědět, protože Wolframovo ambiciózní dílo s neméně arogantním názvem </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A new kind of science</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, je buďto dílem génia, nebo blázna. Jeho dílo je natolik radikální, že nejspíše je dílem člověka, který ztělesňuje oba protipóly. A o co že se jedná?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dle Wolframa, doposud bylo zřejmé, že komplexní chování vyžaduje i složité mechanismy, které chování umožňují. Jeho práce na celulární (buněčných) automatech ale odkryla opak. Celulární automaty jsou N-dimenzionální prostory (většinou ale 2D), které se skládají z mřížky diskrétně oddělených polí. Každé pole může nabývat X různých stavů, v závislosti na transformační funkci, která většinou bere v potaz aktuální stav pole, jeho polohu a stavy sousedících polí. Transformační funkce se aplikuje každé navýšení času T o hodnotu +1. Čas je tedy také diskrétní a symbolizuje pomyslnou evoluci jednotlivých “generací” polí.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sledování toho, jak se jednotlivá pole vyvíjejí do nečekaných a zajímavých tvarů, složenin, či lépe “organismů”, je sama o sobě zábava, přestože zde nenajdeme na konceptuální úrovni příliš složitosti. Asi proto John Conway, matematik a tvůrce </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game of life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> je tolik iritován, že svět si nejspíše bude pamatovat z jeho díla tuto hříčku, spíše než jeho matematický výzkum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wolfram ale celulární automaty vidí jako něco více než jen hříčku. Wolfram ve své knize </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A new kind of science</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> argumentuje, že v podstatě vše ve vesmíru, ať už přírodní či umělé, jsou v jádře procesy, které následují sadu pravidel, a tudíž jsou ekvivalencí komputace (Wolfram, 716). Ba co více, Wolfram věří, že ve vesmíru existuje horní limit, který definuje maximální složitost komputaci, čímž de facto postuluje nový fyzikální zákon. Horní limit složitosti komputace navíc pro Wolframa znamená, že všechny komputační procesy se rovnají Univerzálnímu Turingovu stroji nebo právě celulárnímu automatu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wolfram popisuje, že první záblesk této (pro něj) radikální myšlenky nastal, když nechal počítač vygenerovat všechny možné celulární automaty, jež byly výčtem jednoduchých pravidel, jak se jednotlivá pole mají chovat. Většina z variací nevykazovala překvapivé chování, často po pár generacích nikam nevedla, nebo se ustálila na opakujícím se vzorci. Několik variací ale Wolframa překvapily, neboť minimálně od pohledu vykazovaly náhodné a komplexní chování. To byla epifanie. Později Wolframův spolupracovník prokázal, že tyto pravidla jsou Turing-kompletní, jinak řečeno jsou ekvivalencí všech možných komputačních procesů. Wolfram tvrdí, že existuje N-dimenzionální celulární automat, který po X generacích povede k našemu vesmíru.</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/data/uploads/2014/04/rule30-2.gif\" alt=\"&quot;Wolfram's\" /></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">Celulární automat nazvaný Rule 30</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Čtenář si v textu všiml, že jsem veškeré tvrzení připisoval explicitně Wolframovi. To bylo samozřejmě záměrné, protože úplně nelze souhlasit s tím, že byl Wolframova práce byla skutečně tak radikální, jak se zdá. Jistě, Wolfram je génius a ve své 1000-stránkové knize argumentuje silně pro chápání světa, a tím i fyziky, jako komputace, který je ekvivalencí k celulárnímu automatu. Potíž je v tom, že Wolfram není první, kdo s touto myšlenkou přišel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Další génius, Němec Konrad Zuse se stejnou myšlenkou přišel v 70. letech. Jako Wolfram již tehdy navrhoval, že vesmír je diskrétní a isomorfický k celulárnímu automatu. Ve svém článku Rechnender Raum, který byl přeložen MIT univerzitou jako </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calculating Space</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, předkládá nejen svou tezi, ale také představu, že v budoucnu by fyzikové měli využívat nejen poznatků matematiky, ale též informatiky (Zuse). Zuse tak položil základ toho, co se později stalo novým oborem, digitální fyzikou.</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\"><a href=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/zuse.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-880\" src=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/zuse.png\" alt=\"zuse\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/zuse.png 843w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/zuse-300x264.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/zuse-768x677.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 843px) 100vw, 843px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">Vztah fyziky, matematiky a informatiky dle Konrada Zuse (Zuse, s. 2)</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ZUSE, Konrad.

Nejednalo se ale o skutečnou alternativu k webovým prohlížečům té doby (Netscape či Interner Explorer). Naopak, autor projektem chtěl kriticky přezkoumat do dnešního dne dominantní paradigma procházení internetu prostřednictvím kolekce relativně statických webových stránek. Netomat umožňoval uživateli zadat příkazy v přirozeném jazyce (vzdělání v komputační lingvistice se Wisniewskimu jistě hodilo), které netomat interpretoval. Netomat reagoval tím, že na obrazovku uživatele zobrazil volně se pohybující text, fotografie, videa v mnoha existujích formátech. Jádro myšlenky spočívalo v tom, že procházet web nutně nemusí znamenat obsah, který je zobrazen v rámci jedné statické webové stránky. Wisniewski tak vědomě šel proti veškerým zásadám návrhu uživatelského rozhraní, které má být přístupné, přívětivé a pomáhat k co nejrychlejšímu nalezení relevantních informací. Slovy Wisniewskiho se tak jednalo o anti-browser (Wisniewski). Netomat byl navíc modulárním a rozšiřitelným prohlížečem, který neprivilegoval jeden konkrétní vzhled zobrazení dat. Bylo tedy na uživatelích, aby pomocí netomatovského značkovacího jazyka vytvořili interface, ve kterém budou chtít data zobrazit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Z dnešního pohledu netomat připomíná spíše než browser crawl bota, který používají internetové vyhledávače pro indexování stránky. I dnes lze ale považovat netomat za důležitý projekt, jelikož i po tolika letech se web příliš nezměnil: ano, používáme asynchronní nahrávání obsahu, HTML5, CSS3 a moderní JavaScript, web design také vypadá zcela jinak, každopádně paradigma webového prohlížeče a webové stránky jsme zatím plně nepřekonali.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vysvobození od obdélníkových oken by mohla nabízet rozšířená a virtuální realita, kde interface je sám svět, ať už reálný, nebo virtuální.</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://artport.whitney.org/img/exhibitions/datadynamics/netomat.jpg\" alt=\"data dynamics exhibition at whitney museum, netomat\"></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">Data dynamics výstava ve Whitney museum, netomat</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Propojení světa a volného proudu dat aplikoval sám autor na netartové výstavě Data Dynamics v americkém Whitney muzeu, kde se data promítala na zdech místnosti, čímž Wasniewski přispěl k prvním počinům umělecké vizualizace dat a data artu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WISNIEWSKI, Maciej. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netomat</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> [online].

Umělci apropriují vedle uměleckých i metody tradičně užívané ve vědeckých disciplínách.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Protože se BioArt pohybuje na rozhraní živého/umělého, vyvolává i otázky etické. Toho jsou si umělci vědomi a mnozí chápou své bioartové projekty jako sondu do toho, co je v kontextu modifikace biologických organismů a genetického inženýrství společensky přípustné. I proto jeden z nejznámějších bioartových projektů, fluorescenční králíček Alba od Eduarda Kaca, není pouze o tvorbě samotného “objektu” (geneticky modifikovaného králíka), ale i o společenské recepci díla a vyvolání diskuze nad tím, jak vědecká metoda genetického inženýrství může ovlivnit či již ovlivňuje naše tradiční chápání přírody, biologie, dichotomie přírodního/umělého apod.</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><img src=\"http://www.ekac.org/albagreen.jpeg\" alt=\"Eduard Kac: Rabbit Alba\" /></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">Eduard Kac: Fluorescenční králík Alba</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S příchodem metody CRISPR, pomocí které reálně dokážeme modifikovat genetický kód organismu tak, aby zavedené změny se dále propagovaly i do dalších generací, se etické problémy, na které “transgenetický” (= přenos genů napříč organismy) projekt Eduarda Kaca nevinně upozornil, výrazně násobí. Na jednu stranu je např. žádoucí modifikovat komáry tak, aby nepřenášely malárii; nebo o něco kontroverzněji nabídnout rodičům možnost odstranit z embrya geny, které zvyšují pravděpodobnost toho, že se projeví vážné onemocnění či postižení. Pokud by se ale úprava DNA u lidí stala skutečně běžnou metodou, ryze vědecká metoda se stává politicko-kulturním problémem, kde vyvstávají otázky, kdo a kdy bude mít k těmto metodám přístup. Budou součástí veřejného zdravotnictví, nebo jen procedurou pro ty, kteří si zaplatí? Zatímco západní svět takové otázky vědomě považuje za tabu, což ke kritickému zkoumání a diskuzi rozhodně nepomáhá, Čína se nenápadně stala vědeckou mocností v genomice a genetickém inženýrstvím. Čínská politika jednoho dítěte je ve skutečnosti formou sociálního inženýrství a Čína horlivě monitoruje děti od útlého věku tak, aby dokázala predikovat a doporučit, čemu by se děti měly v životě věnovat. CRISPR, zdá se, bude pro Čínu jen další metodou, jak pokračovat ve svém snažení.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Západní svět nechce o takových projektech ani slyšet. Otázkou je, jak dlouho budeme moci strkat hlavu do písku; jak dlouho bude trvat, než movitější budou cestovat do zemí, kde genetické úpravy budou legální, aby zajistili svým dětem i sobě chování-funkce, které budou pokládat za prospěšné?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BioArt, dle mého, tuhle amnézii může prolomit tím, že rozvíří povědomí o tom, co je nejen technologicky, ale také eticky možné.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Při své zahleděnosti do sebe sama, aka starý dobrý antropocentrismus, bychom lehce zapomněli, že interakce živého/umělého přináší kontroverze i na druhé straně: v umělém. Je dost možné, že na cestě k čistě umělé inteligenci projdeme mezičlánkem, tedy kyborgem. Neboť vytvoření nové formy inteligence je, zdá se mi, mnohem těžší úkol, než splynutí již existujícího a evolucí stvořeného lidského mozku. Revoluci bude předcházet evoluce. Teprve kvantitativní změny povedou ke kvalitativním.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeden z hi-tech bioartových projektů, který se snaží vytvořit kybernetický organismus, je dílo slovinské umělkyně Maji Smrekar. Její projekt </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ion Flux / First level </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">z roku 2010 zahrnuje použití biočipu, který elektricky stimuluje neurononé buňky a zároveň čte výstup z toho, jaké signály buňky vrací. Stimulovací neuronové buňky tvoří neuronovou síť, která se bude učit a uchovávat změny z učení ve zformované paměti. Účelem dle slov umělkyně je tímto procesem vytvořit “emancipovanou bytost”, jejíž chování bude záviset na struktuře neuronové sítě, která se, podobně jako u lidí, mění v závislosti na učení. (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ion Flux / First level</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mnozí známí futuristé, v čele například s Ray Kurzweilem, věří, že umělá inteligence nebude v blízké budoucnosti pouhou fikcí, ale realitou. Jakmile se tak stane, umělá inteligence s digitální myslí a prakticky neomezeným výpočetním výkonem předčí lidský mozek, o kterém Kurzweil píše:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Lidský mozek obsahuje 100 miliard neuronů a mezi dvěma neurony existuje 1000 spojení. Tyto spojení fungují velmi pomalu, na úrovni 200 výpočtu za vteřinu. Ale 100 miliard neuronů vynásobených 1000 spojeními tvoří paralelismus na úrovni 100 biliónů. Vynásobíme-li toto číslo 200 výpočty za vteřinu, dělá to 20 milionů miliard kalkulací za vteřinu, či v počítačové terminologii, 20 miliard MIPS. A 20 miliard MIPS budeme mít za 1000 dolarů do roku 2020”. (T</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he human machine merger: are we headed for the matrix?</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zákon exponenciálního růstu evolučního procesu, který Kurzweil často propaguje, nám říká, že v roce 2055 za stejnou cenu získáme procesor o výkonu mozků všech lidí na planetě. S těmito čísly se současné pletky s problematickou etikou čínského výzkumu či obavy z </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">technologické nezaměstnanosti</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> zdají být triviální. Přesto vycházejí ze stejného principu: exponenciálního nárůstu výkonu a schopností technologie.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V posledních pár letech se skutečně v mainstreamové kultuře začalo více mluvit o vlivu technologie a (antropomorfizovaných) robotů. Je to jen povrch toho, co umělá inteligence znamená: budoucí relevanci lidstva. Možná ale existuje jednoduché řešení. Zakážeme-li vývoj této technologie. K tomu by ale byl potřeba konsensus všech zemí a institucí schopných takto technicky náročného vývoje. To mi nepřijde pravděpodobné, neboť důvodů, proč se tímto směrem vydat je několik, ekonomická a vojenská dominance napadnou člověka jako první.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jak dlouho lidstvo jako organismus vydrží? Kdo ví, ale zdá se, že pokud se chceme za pár let vyrovnat entitám, které jsme sami stvořili, budeme muset sami sebe re-designovat a implementovat aspoň něco z toho, co jsme vložili do tvorby AI. Splyneme s technologií. Budeme muset. A je načase, aby tento koncept pronikl do kolektivního vědomí a imaginace lidstva. K tomu má umění velmi dobré předpoklady, neboť kromě konceptů a teorií dokáže produkovat vnímatelné objekty, jež jsou jako manifestace idejí přístupnější širšímu publiku. BioArt jako umělecký výzkum symbiózy technologického a organického má zásadní roli v diseminaci myšlenek a edukaci publika o tom, co bude epochou přinejmenším tak významnou, jak předchozí technologické revoluce dohromady.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technologie jako vymáhání přírody pohltí i svého tvůce. Před tím varoval již Heidegger. Jak destruktivní událost to bude, nevíme.

Zjednodušeně se tedy jedná o chybu, kterou je ale třeba specifikovat dále, protože v prostředí softwarového vývoje najdeme hned několik typů. Glitch jako softwarová chyba neodkazuje pouze k syntaktické, logické či sémantické chybě v kódu, ale častěji k chybě, kdy kód je v pořádku a externí faktor jako propustnost sítě, rychlost disku apod. je zdrojem nečekaného chodu programu (Fuller, s. 111).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glitche se objeví v mnoha objektivně vnímatelných formách, v prostředí softwaru především v audiovizuální podobě, ale s vývojem interakčního designu je možné si představit Glitche u objektů, senzorů, které cílí i na další lidské smysly, například haptické senzory u moderních mobilních zařízeních. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byly to ale Glitche audiovizuální, které ustanovily Glitch jako fenomén hodný podrobnému zkoumání, a proto termín “Glitch” lze rozšířit i o význam, který referuje k celé kultuře a hnutím, jež se teoreticky, kriticky a umělecky zabývají Glitchem jako objektem estetického zájmu. Ten se soustředí na jednu z hlavních vlastností Glitche, kterou je nahodilost výskytu a vzhledu. Princip náhody jakožto faktor, který je zakomponován do tvorby audiovizuálních děl, není samo o sobě nic nového a z dějepisu umění se dozvíme, že s náhodou si pohrávalo mnoho avant-gardních umělců první poloviny dvacátého století. Proces vzniku slova DADA, ze kterého se stalo označení celého uměleckého směru, je jen jedním z příkladů, jaký vliv měla náhoda v umění.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Náhoda a Glitch ale nebyly atraktivní pro umělce a teoretiky pouze na konceptuální úrovni. Estetika těchto audiovizuálních artefaktů zaujala natolik, že artefakty začaly být kopírovány a produkovány uměle. Byla-li na začátku náhoda dominantním aspektem Glitche, jak pak můžeme uchopit fakt, že Glitche začaly být “sbírány” jako vzácné suvenýry, jejichž vzhled byl postupně převeden do algoritmu, který z Glitche učinil sice nový, svébytný vizuální jazyk, avšak mechanizace jejich tvorby z nich odstranila to zajímavé, konceptuální jádro, tedy náhodu? Z nutnosti analyticky rozlišit způsob vzniku Glitche se zavedly názvy “pure glitch” a “glitch alike”, kde první označuje pravý glitch, který vznikl nečekaným problémem v technickém systému, kdežto “glitch alike” se používá pro řízenou pseudo-náhodu vytvořenou člověkem-umělcem za účelem estetického vyjádření.</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\">[vimeo 52214011 w=600&amp;h=380]</p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">Sabrina Ratté — AURAE</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teoretici Olga Goriunová a Alexei Shulgin tvrdí, že z pohledu teorie je Glitch jako fenomén zajímavý nejen kvůli zabudovanému konceptu náhody, ale také kvůli tomu, že ne-funkce systému nám odkrývá něco důležitého; konkrétně glitch v systému nic netušícímu uživateli-divákovi zpřístupňuje jinak neviditelné části systému, které jsou schovány za fungujícím uživatelským rozhraním (UI). A právě dle autorů tenhle voyerský pohled do útrob systému lze také chápat:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[&#8230;] manifestaci skutečné softwarové estetiky. Počítače jako takové nemají jasně určenou estetiku, která se značí určitou autenticitou a plností.” (Fuller, s. 111)</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Autoři dále ve svém textu argumentují, že stroj vždy čerpal převážně z utilitárních principů svého návrhu, což později vedlo k tomu, že tyto ryze na funkci zaměřené návrhy se staly samotnou estetikou objektu/systému. Podle autorů Glitch nabízí takovému pojetí strojové estetiky protiváhu tím, že zavádí iracionální či spontánní prvky do jinak technicky dokonalého chodu systému. Autoři svou tezi v textu rozvíjejí, přesto dále staví na těchto zmíněných vlastnostech Glitche v kontextu návrhu softwarových systémů. Ačkoli Glitch považuji za zajímavý koncept v tom, že uživatelům odkrývá to, co mělo být skryto, a tak skutečně průměrnému uživateli poskytuje úvod do “epistemologie a ontologie stroje”, neboť v terminologii teoretiků Grusina a Boltera: immediované prvky jsou rázem hypermediované; v uvažování Goriunové a Shulgina vidím nekoherentnost, neboť pro mě autenticita znamená především přirozenost. Netuším, proč by zrovna ne-funkční, chybné, iracionální či člověku se podobající vlastnosti měly představovat “autentickou estetiku” softwarového systému. Naopak, antropomorfizaci strojů vidím jako to, čím jest, tedy pokládání, něčeho za to, co není, či poněkud obskurněji řečeno: za de-autentizaci. Nic to nemění na tom, že téma propojující UI, jeho čistě digitální estetiku a autenticitu je natolik zajímavé, že si zaslouží samostatnou esej.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Přes veškerou zjevnou dominanci vizuálna najdeme Glitch i v hudbě. Můj oblíbený příklad je proces vzniku čtyřdílného alba </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Disintegration Loops</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> od skladatele Williama Basinskiho. Krátce před 9/11 se Basinski rozhodl digitalizovat jeho staré audiokazety, na kterých byly nahrané hudební smyčky. Basinski nechal digitalizér několik hodin pracovat. Když se ale vrátil, zjistil, že pásky se zamotaly a během digitalizace z nich postupně odpadávala feritová vrstva, na které je samotné audio uložené. Vizionář Basinski ale proces nechal pokračovat. Výsledný záznam je několikahodinová ambientní smyčka, vyjadřující prostor, který je naplněn melancholií. Jakoby digitalizace zachytila nejen degradovaný analogový zvuk, ale i scénu, která se toho dne, 11. 9. 2001, stala, a na kterou Basinski dobře viděl ze svého apartmánu. Kolaps věží viděl a nahrál na video, ze kterého pak vytvořil jednotlivé fotografie, jež se ocitly na obalu cd. Dle mého zbytečně, vše podstatné z toho dne, zcela náhodně, ztělesňuje zglitchovaná audio stopa.</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mjnAE5go9dI\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">Glitch v hudbě, William Basinski &#8211; The Disintegration Loops</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FULLER, Matthew (ed.). </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software studies: a lexicon</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Má odtažitost nejspíš pramenila z odporu, který jsem pociťoval při čtení prvních odstavců textu: “tohle, že má být zásadní dílo na téma kyberkultury, nových médií a obecně digitálního univerza?”. Byly to totiž květnatý jazyk a na první pohled přehnaná literární dikce textu, které mě odrazovaly. Vždyť i velká literatura se dá psát čistým a přímočarým jazykem, čest vám, pane Kafka. Před několika dny jsem si ale řekl, dobrá, musím si text přečíst, určitě to bude u státních zkoušek, kdo ví. Navíc téma textu se zdá být dostatečně kontroverzní, a proto důležité. Zvláště dnes, kdy se do našich domovů nekontrolovaně plíží virtuální realita, která propojuje naše staré, analogové smysly s více než vzrušující sadou nových počitků, které nabízí digitální svět. </p>\n<p>Článek ale nepojednává o hyper-realistických VR simulacích z roku 2016, mezi které patří třeba současný systém Oculus nebo HoloLens od Microsoftu, nýbrž o online komunitě LambaMOO, která vznikla kolem roku 1991. Článek byl sice publikován v roce 1993, ale i po dvou letech byla LambaMOO stále online komunitou, kde celá komunikace a interakce mezi hráči “běžela” v textovém režimu. Paměťníkům se tak může vybavit několik tzv. interaktivních fikcí, které okupovaly místo prvních počítačových her ze žánru Her na hrdiny, případně si vzpomenou na offline vzor Dračí doupě. LamdaMOO i zmíněné příklady mají společné to, že samotná hra se vytváří při interpretaci slov a vět, které si pak hráč převádí podle vlastní představivosti do virtuálního světa, který není až tak v počítači nebo na papíře, ale spíše, troufám si tvrdit, v myslích hráčů. To je ale bod, ke kterému se ještě vrátím. Přízvisko “MOO” v názvu online komunity znamená, že hráči této textové online virtuální reality mohli obsah hry rozšiřovat pomocí objektově orientovaného programování (odtud OO, object-oriented; M v názvu odkazuje k MUD, Multi-User Dungeon), což v praxi znamenalo, že hráči vytvářeli vlastní chatovací místnosti, kterým vtiskli atmosféru tím, že podrobně popsali, co se v místnosti nachází; a také vytvářeli předměty s různorodými vlastnostmi. Vzpomeňme si na první díl trilogie Matrix, kde u konce filmu Neo získává schopnosti, jež mu dovolují manipulovat, respektive přeprogramovat realitu, čímž se de facto stává polobohem. Ve schopnosti přeprogramovávat (virtuální) reality tkví moc. A tu se rozhodl zneužít jeden z hráčů.</p>\n<p>Hráč s přezdívkou Mr. Bungle vstoupil ve světě LamdaMOO do jedné z mistností, která se hemžila hráči. Pro svůj čin si vybral a napsal podprogram voodoo panenky, pomocí které ovládl postavy několika ostatních hráčů. Zničehonic tito hráči pod svým jménem začali psát a popisovat obscénní sexuální akty.  Mr. Bungle sám tyto akty komentoval a za každou větou přidal svůj smích. Jedna z vět zněla:<br />\n“Jako kdyby proti své vůli si Moondreamer zapíchla do zadku nůž na steaky, což jí způsobilo nesmírné potěšení. V dálce slyšíte Mr. Bungleho jak se ďábelsky směje.”</p>\n<p>Je zřejmé, že se jedná o hloupou a infantilní větu, jenže pro objektivní posouzení tohoto činu  se člověk musí vžít do situaci, kdy něco takového se zobrazilo najednou desítkám lidí, se kterými jste strávili ve světě LamdaMOO stovky a stovky hodin. Přijde mi, že převedením do dnešního kontextu sociálních sítích by se našla vhodná analogie na Facebooku; jak bychom se cítili, kdyby nám podobné věci někdo napsal na “zeď”?</p>\n<p>Jistě, naše reakce by byly odlišné a do velké míry ovlivněné jednak tím, jak moc do Facebooku investujeme svůj čas a sociální kapitál, a také, koho na Facebooku máme v přátelích. Faktem je, že jedna uživatelka, na kterou byl tento útok mířen, se svěřila, že utrpěla post-traumatický šok a slzy jí tekly po tvářích. </p>\n<p>Vedle postihnutých tímto činem i další uživatelé, kteří byli při útoku přítomní, okamžitě požadovali, aby byl Mr. Bungle potrestán, neboť něco takového (nejen) v komunitě LamdaMOO hráčů bylo nepřípustné. V chatovací místnosti se spustila dlouhá diskuze, jak přesně má být tento trest vykonán. Sama postižená uživatelka následujícího dne navrhla, aby Mr. Bungle byl “toaded”.  V angličtině “toad” znamená bídák i ropucha, a právě ropucha, respektive čistě rituální metamorfóza v ropuchu, a nakonec smazání uživatelského účtu je to, co debatující navrhli, že si Mr. Bungle zaslouží.</p>\n<p>Ačkoli se rozhodnutí zdálo na začátku jako jednohlasné, postupně debata odhalila několik problémů. Prvním problémem bylo, že několik týdnů před incidentem si Wizardi řekli, že už nebudou zasahovat do společenského dění komunity, budou pouze technickými administrátory, kteří budou vykonávat vůli “lidu”.  To ale znamenalo, že se komunita hráčů musela rychle transformovat v něco, co by připomínalo společnost tak, jak ji známe v reálném světě “tam venku”.</p>\n<p>A proto druhý problém byl politický. Někteří z uživatelů tvrdili, že jsou jednoznačně pro trest, ale jelikož neexistují žádné zákony, kterými by se komunita oficiálně řídila, není možné se k žádnému zákona dožadovat, a tím pádem ani žádného trestu. Další tvrdili, že je nutné účet Mr. Bungla okamžitě smazat, takže by administrátoři (těm se říkalo Wizardi), kteří mají jako jediní moc smazat účet, měli jednat. A pak tu byli tzv. techno-libertariáni, jak je autor článku nazval, kteří tvrdili, že není prakticky možné se vyhnout tomu, aby se na serveru objevili lidé, kteří touží dělat potíže. Navrhovali tak, aby řešení bylo technické rázu: například zavedením nového příkazu, který by od zvoleného uživatele filtroval a nezobrazoval text.</p>\n<p>Jelikož autor článku byl “fyzicky” přítomen v chatovací místnosti, kde tato diskuze probíhala, mohl podrobněji popsat, co se v ní odehrálo. Pro mě osobně byla tato evoluce od bezvládí k volání po nějakém politické, ba dokonce i právním systému urychelnou historickou exkurzí k tomu, jak se vyvíjely myšlenky o ideálním uspořádání komunity lidí. Jinak řečeno, nad vládou a právem člověk ohrnuje nos, dokud se mu něco nestane, poté se jich zas dovolává jako teenager rodičů, když to v jednom zapadlém klubu přežene s alkoholem.</p>\n<p>Odbočil jsem ale od hlavního tématu, kterým bylo znásilnění. V reálném světě si odsouzený za znásilnění odsedí pár let ve vězení. Bylo možné požadovat, aby se Mr. Bungle dočkal stejného osudu, měl jít na několik let do reálného vězení? Pokud ne, musíme být konzistentní a říct, že ten incident nebyl skutečné znásilnění, ale něco jiného. Vždyť se to vše přeci odehrálo ve virtuálním prostoru, a to ještě v roce 1993, kdy virtuální prostor většinou tvořily bílé písmo na černém pozadí. Jak si ale vysvětlíme, že čin ve virtuálním světě měl skutečné následky, konkrétně post-traumatický stres, ve světě reálném? Může někdo znásilnit slovy? Pokud je mi známo, tak aktivita jménem “sexting” často vede k vyvrcholení na druhé, pozitivnější straně sexuálního spektra. A zde jsou také použity pouze slova a představivost.</p>\n<p>Na druhou stranu by někdo mohl namítat, že uživatelka jednoduše mohla z celé konverzace odejít, a to okamžitě, jelikož jí k tomu stačilo na svém počítači zavřít černé okno, ve kterém se celá textová virtuální realita odehrávala. Otázkou je, zda bychom tímto krokem nedali Mr. Bunglemu a jemu podobným signál, že jeho chování je v pořádku, že mu nic nehrozí za to, když tyto obscénnosti bude šířit ve světě. V tom virtuálním. Pokud by se vše odehrálo ve světě reálném, ať už v parku či na pracovišti, Bunglemu by rychle jeho smích přešel. On by ale v reálném světě nic takového neudělal. Abych byl přesný, oni. Protože se zjistilo, že za účtem Mr. Bungle se skrývalo několik univerzitní studentů z New Yorku, kteří se údajně předháněli v tom, kdo vymyslí horší a podlejší představy sexuálních aktů.</p>\n<p>Celý incident si po pečlivém zvážení vzal na svá bedra jeden z Wizardů, který Bungleho účet smazal. Tiše, bez zbytečného rozruchu. Ostatní se o tom prvně dozvěděli tak, že použili jeden z dostupných příkazů @who jméno_uzivatele, který vrátil údaj o tom, kde se příslušný uživatel nachází.  Příkaz v případě Bungleho vracel, že uživatelské jméno nelze v databázi najít.</p>\n<p>Podle mého názoru to byl přesně ten trest, který si Mr. Bungle zasloužil. Třebaže si myslím, že jeho chování bylo nevhodné, nedokážu si představit, že bych souhlasil s tím, aby si odseděl několik let. Ne kvůli tomu, že by znásilnění nemělo být potrestáno, ale proto, že se nejednalo znásilnění, kterému všichni rozumíme a máme pro něj dobrou definici.<br />\nSlova nejsou neškodná, proto po světě existují v mnoha zemích zákony postihující tzv. “hate speech”,  rasismus, hlášení se k nacistickému Německu či, jako například v České republice, popírání holocaustu a kriminálních činů spáchaných představitely komunistického režimu. Osobně se stavím k těmto zákonům rozpačitě. Ne že bych snad tyto činy jakkoli podporoval, ale stojím v tomto případě na straně lidí jako Salman Rushdie či Noam Chomsky, kteří prohlašují, a teď parafrázuji, že zlo nikdy nevymizí, ať se budeme snažit sebevíc, proto je lepší mít toto zlo před nosem, vidět na něj, mít na něj posvíceno, spíše než ho nechat růst potají v temnotě. Lidé se vždy bojí více toho, co není vidět. Zároveň z odsouzených děláme svým způsobem trpitele,  kteří jsou pak vzory a vzpruhou pro jejich přívržence, neboť tím v jejich očích validujeme jejich názor, že svět se proti nim a jejich pravdě spiknul a nenechá je ani jejich myšlenky veřejně vyslovit.</p>\n<p>Je snad možnéstejný argument použí i v online světě? Řekl bych, že ano, a dokonce i o něco  efektivněji, protože zavřít jedno okno operačního systému je jednodušší, než se zbavit agresivního člověka na ulici.</p>\n<p>Současné právo ale nesouhlasí a výše zmíněné slovní akty zakazuje a trestá. Dobrá, to je ale reálný, fyzický svět, jehož mechanismy a pravidla nelze jednoduše a jedna ku jedné přenášet online. V kruzích odborníků i laiků se celé infrastruktuře Internetu, od digitálního kódu, přes kabely, až po webové stránky, říká Nové médium. A to nikoli z nedostatku lingvistické invence, ale právě proto, že toto Nové médium představuje zcela něco revolučního: systém či svět, kde mnoho z našeho fyzického světa neplatí. Nové médium nezná fyzikální zákony. </p>\n<p>Člověk v něm může lítat, být motýlem, muži nezapomínají na narozeniny svých partnerek, a ty zas pro změnu přitahuje nahý muž v ponožkách. Představivost nezná mezí. To není otřepaná fráze, nýbrž teoretický poznatek toho, že Nové médium, teoreticky umožňuje</p>\n<p>vše, co si lidská mysl představí. Jen si to musí dokázat představit. Teoreticky, pro upozornění.<br />\nNové médium, ostatně jako technologie jako taková, totiž  není vně společnosti, ale je její nedílnou součástí. Proto je prakticky do velké míry na lidech, jaký vztah k technologii budou mít. Je zcela představitelné, že za pár let se demokraticky rozhodneme, že pro tohle Nové médium bude platit maximum zákonů z fyzického světa, pokud to technologie dovolí. Zde ale vidím kontradikci. Nové médium je nové, dokud má dostatek radikálně odlišných vlastností. Čím více budeme chtít na něj aplikovat zvyklosti fyzického světa, tím více budeme o toto Nové médium přicházet. Pro podporu této myšlenky lze zmínit i čistě technický argument, který byl mnohokrát využit: implementovat všechna omezení fyzického světa do světa digitálního, tedy do světa novomediálního, je technicky velmi obtížně proveditelné, většinou za cenu enormní redukce celé podstaty tohoto novomediálního světa a možností, které nabízí.</p>\n<p>Nepsaná pravidla komunity LamdaMOO byla jasná: všichni jsme tu rozumní lidé, takže se nebudeme navzájem urážet, ani si jinak být na obtíž. Jenže nepsaná pravidla fungují pouze do té doby, dokud je všichni zúčastnění dodržují. Jakmile je někdo jednou významně poruší, začnou ostatní vyžadovat, aby se oficiálně kodifikovala, neboť pouze tak je lze vymáhat. Nepsaná pravidla ale mají svůj půvab v tom, že jsou právě nepsaná, což možná zní jako uvažování v kruhu, ale nechtěl jsem říct nic jiného než to, že pokud máme něco napsat, co má mít smysl a logickou konzistenci, vyžaduje to podrobnou analýzu a v případě práva i jasných požadavků toho, co se vlastně po právu chce. </p>\n<p>Obávám se, že žádné právo, které za něco stojí, v té době nemohlo jasně určit, jak s Mr. Bunglem naložit. Právo samozřejmě reaguje na společenské změny a nové technologie. Jenže to je proces, který vyžaduje čas. Setkáme-li se s radikálně novou situací, jakou je například sexuální obtěžování v textové virtuální realitě, můžeme se stát, že nikdo jednoznačnou odpověď neposkytne, protože žádná taková jednoznačná odpověď není.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ke článku Juliana Dibbella jsem se musel vrátit hned několikrát, než jsem se rozhodl si jej celý přečíst.

Hned za mnohaletým studiem pedagogiky a příbuzných disciplín se nabízí možnost aplikovat těžce nabyté zkušenosti z první ruky nebo od kolegů. Dále zájemci mohou využít podrobné, avšak často nepřístupné texty z akademických publikací, nebo naopak psané přístupným jazykem, ale zas postrádající hlubší analýzu a odkazy na původní výzkum. Nakonec je tu v tomto článku recenzované dílo <em>How learning works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching</em>, jehož autoři se netají svou důvěrou v to, že dokázali napsat knihu, která v sobě vhodně kombinuje všechny výše zmíněné prvky: zkušenosti, teorii a <em>na výzkumu postavená fakta</em>, které je možné okamžitě aplikovat ve vyučování. Kniha si klade za cíl vytvořit praktický manuál syntetizující bez zbytečného žargonu empirická data a na výzkumu založené teorie. Jinak řečeno, kniha má být potřebným „mostem mezi výzkumem a praxí“, určená pro široké publikum: od univerzitních učitelů, studentů až po knihovníky a instruktory na středních školách (AMBROSE, s. 2). Podívejme se, do jaké míry se autorům povedlo svůj záměr naplnit.</p>\n<p>Kniha nám v úvodu citátem vědce Herberta A. Simona připomíná, že učení probíhá vždy na straně studenta, v jeho činech a stylu myšlení. Proč? Autoři odpovídají, že učení nelze chápat jako hmatatelný hotový výsledek, nýbrž jako <em>proces</em>, který se odehrává v mysli studenta na základě jeho intepretace a reakcí na zážitky, ať už vědomých či nevědomých, minulých či budoucích. Učení předpokládá změnu ve znalostech, chování a postojích, která má pozitivní dopad na studentův výkon a jeho schopnost se dále zlepšovat v učení.(Tamtéž, s. 3) Jelikož učení je kontinuální interakcí mysli a zážitků, není možné, odpustíme-li od zatím stále futuristických sci-fi vyobrazení, mít přímý kontakt s procesem učením (tedy obsahem mysli studenta). Co vyučujícímu „zbývá“, je volit takové strategie, jež při všech dostupných možnostech otestování vedou k preferovanému výkonu studenta. A právě tyto strategie, respektive sedm hlavních principů, které čerpají z oborů kognitivní, vývojové, sociální psychologie, antropologie, pedagogiky a dalších, kniha nabízí. Tyto principy a učení kniha pojímá holisticky: student není nepopsaný papír, ale přináší si s sebou do třídy zkušenosti a znalosti ovlivněné společenským a kulturním prostředím, ze kterých pochází a ve kterých se pohybuje.</p>\n<p>Předtím, než se zaměřím na shrnutí jednotlivých principů podrobněji, vyjmenovávám na začátku, jak to činí sama kniha, všechny principy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Předchozí znalosti studentů mohou napomáhat, nebo naopak bránit ve studiu</em></li>\n<li><em>Organizace znalostí ovlivňuje, jak se studenti učí a aplikují, co již znají</em></li>\n<li><em>Motivace studentů rozhoduje, vede a podporuje jejich vztah ke studiu</em></li>\n<li><em>K dosáhnutí mistrovství v určité činnosti musí studenti ovládat komponentní dovednosti, včetně schopnosti je integrovat a vědět, kdy dovednosti aplikovat</em></li>\n<li><em>Cvičení zaměřené na plnění cílů a cílená zpětná vazba podporují kvalitu studia</em></li>\n<li><em>Aktuální úroveň (emocionálního a intelektuálního) vývoje studentů interaguje se sociálním, emocionálním a intelektuálním prostředím třídy a ovlivňuje učení</em></li>\n<li><em>K tomu, aby se studenti mohli učit samostatně, musí se naučit monitorovat a upravovat svůj přístup k učení</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Organizace knihy je podřízena vytyčenému cíli, tedy praktickému použití, a tak struktura každé kapitoly následuje přehlednou identickou šablonu: nejdříve jsou zmíněny dva fiktivní příběhy ze života učitelů, které v narativní, dobře si představitelné formě poskytují čtenáři konkrétní příklad, ve kterém za problémy stojí právě zvolený, abstraktní princip. Tak třeba v hned první kapitole čteme příběh univerzitního učitele, který si před testem v předmětu statistika ověřuje, zda studenti jsou obeznámeni se základními koncepty. Přestože studenti tvrdili, že ano, v testu to nedokáže většina studentů prokázat. Zmatený vyučující nechápe, proč studenti rovnou neřekli, že tyto koncepty neznají či nechápou — někteří intuitivně vědí, proč tomu tak je; kniha tuto znalost formuluje explicitně. Analýza těchto příběhů odkrývá jeden ze sedmi hlavních principů, kterému zbytek kapitoly jednak poskytuje pozadí relevantního vědeckého výzkumu, jednak nabízí sadu strategií, jak znalost principů využít ve svůj prospěch.</p>\n<p>Vedle kapitol zaměřených na hlavní principy nabízí kniha ještě jeden logický krok: natočení principů směrem ke čtenáři-pedagogovi a jejich aplikaci na „učení se učit“. Závěrem kniha obsahuje 47 stránkový appendix, ve kterém čtenář najde doplňující, často ukázkový materiál v podobě formulářů a testů, ze kterých lze čerpat inspiraci pro reálnou aplikaci sedmi hlavních principů.</p>\n<h2 class=\"Customheader02\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">Shrnutí sedmi principů</span></h2>\n<h3>Kapitola 1: Jak předchozí znalosti studentů ovlivňují jejich schopnost učení?</h3>\n<p>První kapitola upozorňuje, že studenti nepřichází do třídy jako tabula rasa, ale přináší si s sebou znalosti, zážitky, koncepty a mentální modely, které buďto mohou učení napomáhat, nebo naopak budou mít spíše negativní dopad na zlepšení a pochopení. Jelikož předchozí znalosti „ovlivňují, jak studenti filtrují a interpretují příchozí informace“ (Tamtéž, s. 13) a studenti musí nezbytně „během učení propojit nové znalosti s předchozími“ (Tamtéž, s. 13), za ideální stav lze považovat předchozí znalosti, které představují pevný a relevantní základ, na kterém lze při podání vhodných instrukcí stavět a rozšiřovat znalosti vedoucí k učení.</p>\n<p>Studenti, kteří by splňovali takové podmínky, jsou spíše výjimkou. Mnohem pravděpodobněji studenti budou vykazovat znalosti, které jsou <em>neaktivní</em>, <em>nedostatečné</em>, <em>nepřesné</em> či <em>nevhodné</em>, kde každý typ znalostí z tohoto výčtu klade před studenty a pedagogy problémy vyžadující poněkud odlišné strategie, jak se s nimi vypořádat. Tak například aktivace předchozích znalostí, jež vede k trvalejší integraci znalostí nových, vyžaduje, aby otázky spíše než na vyjmenování faktografických údajů se zaměřovaly na <em>elaboraci</em> odpovědi, k čemuž můžete studenta přimět tehdy, když se budeme ptát „proč“ se něco událo, „proč“ je stav věcí takový, jaký je. Na tento koncept (ang. elaborative interrogation) autoři knihy navazují distinkcí mezi <em>deklarativními </em>(znalost typu Co) a <em>procedurálními </em>znalostmi (znalost typu Jak a Kdy), která neupřednostňuje jeden typ znalosti před druhým, ale upozorňuje, že tyto rozdíly existují a jsou fundamentální, především v tom, jak si je studenti osvojují a aplikují. K aktivní a dostatečné znalosti matematiky nestačí znát pouze vzorečky (deklarativní znalost), ale je nutné vědět, kdy a jak vzoreček vhodně použít k řešení daného problému. Podobně autoři zmiňují studenta designového oboru, který disponuje hlubokými procedurálními znalostmi, ale nedostatečné osvojení si teorií, tedy deklarativních znalostí, problematizuje transfer znalostí z jednoho kontextu do druhého. Kontext je významný i při studiu odborné terminologie a teorií, jejichž význam a platnost se napříč obory často liší. Autoři proto doporučují vyjmenovat explicitně seznam kontextů, ve kterých je daná znalost platná.</p>\n<p>Porozumění tomu, jaké předchozí znalosti studenti skutečně mají, nám dle autorů usnadňuje navržení vhodnějšího způsobu předávání instrukcí a probírané látky. Analýza jejich skutečných znalostí pomáhá nejen v učení jako takovém, ale přináší dobré informace na to, co přesně studentům chybí, co nechápou, a tak vyučující může aktivně tyto nedostatky napravovat.</p>\n<h3>Kapitola 2: Jak způsob, jak studenti organizují znalosti, ovlivňuje učení?</h3>\n<p>Druhá kapitola se zaměřuje na organizaci znalostí a nabízí vhled do důležitých rozdílů mezi organizací u studentů a expertů. Experti se liší tím, že své znalosti organizují do velkých konceptuálních tzv. „chunků“ (kusů), které jim umožňují rychlý přístup a práci se znalostmi. Související důležitou schopností expertů je klasifikace nových informací na základě toho, že rychle rozpoznají v obsahu vzorce, které jsou významné, a naopak části informací, které jsou irelevantní. To vede k tomu, že experti nemusí procházet informace sekvenčně, případ od případu, ale využívají zkratek a skoků, kterých studenti nejsou schopni. Kniha pro podložení těchto faktů cituje např. dnes již klasický výzkum akademiků Chasea a Herberta A. Simona z roku 1973, který prokazuje, že šachoví velmistři se liší od méně zkušených kolegů tím, že jsou schopni rychle rozpoznat z dané konfigurace šachových kamenů, které pozice mají smysl, a které jsou nehratelné.</p>\n<p>Příběhy ze začátku druhé kapitoly upozorňují na to, že učitel jako expert v dané oblasti formuluje svůj výklad k studentům na základě své organizace znalostí a nemůže očekávat, že mentální mapy studentů se budou jakkoli jeho organizaci blížit. Tento poznatek čtenáře knihy nejspíše nepřekvapuje, autoři ale upozorňují, že expertní znalosti jsou (právě tím, že jsou expertní) nevědomé. Učitel tak musí vynaložit cílené úsilí, aby si uvědomil, nejen jak organizuje to, co ví, ale také celý kurz a sylabus. Tento explicitní pohled na uspořádání znalostí ze strany učitele by dle autorů měl vést k tomu, že učitel jako „designér“ navrhne všechny části kurzu tak, aby co nejvíce u studentů podporovaly organizaci znalostí, kterou učitel, testy či probíraná látka vyžadují.</p>\n<h3>Kapitola 3: Jaké faktory motivují studenty k učení?</h3>\n<p>Na studenty nastupující na univerzitu jsou kladeny nejen vyšší intelektuální nároky, ale také se musí vypořádat s novou, relativně větší autonomií v tom, jak své studium povedou a kterým předmětům budou věnovat pozornost. Jak ale příběhy ze začátku kapitoly 3 upozorňují, nadšení a konsekventně výkon studenta jsou do velké míry formovány jeho motivací.</p>\n<p>Motivací autoři rozumí individuální investici (prostředků, času, atd.) do aktivity, která by měla vést k požadovanému stavu či výsledku. Výzkum citovaný autory ukazuje, že v prostředí vzdělávání motivace představuje důležitý determinant intenzity, odhodlanosti a kvality chování vedoucí k učení. Kapitola nabízí podrobnou analýzu motivace a přidružených konceptů, pro jejichž pochopení je vhodné knihu přečíst, zde shrnu kapitolu v knize obrázkem ilustrovaným rámcem, kde sama motivace se skládá z komponent-prekurzorů v podobě <em>hodnot </em>a <em>očekávání</em>: pokud student v probírané látce rozpoznává užitečnost, hodnotnost obsahu (ať už jako hodnotu inherentní či instrumentální) a zároveň existuje přijatelná pravděpodobnost, že vynaložení úsilí je cestou k pozitivnímu výsledku, lze hovořit o ideální půdě pro budování studentovy motivace.</p>\n<p>Motivace k čemu?, ptají se autoři. Aby motivace byla produktivní, musí ústit v aktivitu. Ta se odvíjí od <em>cílů</em> (goal-oriented motivace), které jako kompas řídí a směřují pozornost studenta na relevantní činnost, jejichž naplnění vede ke zvýšení znalostí, zlepšení výkonu, jednoduše řečeno k učení. Zcela v souladu s vytyčeným holistickým pohledem kniha upozorňuje, že cíle nepochází jen z požadavků kurzu, ale čerpá z „intelektuálního a kreativního snažení, sociálních a mezilidských vztahů, identity a sebepojetí, potřeby bezpečí a materiálního vlastností, a touze vést produktivní a kompetentní život.“ (Tamtéž, s. 79).</p>\n<p>I když je student namotivován a odhodlán plnit stanovené cíle, procesu učení může bránit nevhodné prostředí, jež místo podpory a stimulace obsahuje demotivační elementy. Součástí prostředí je samozřejmě učitel, kterému kapitola poskytuje rozsáhlou sadu strategií, jak studenta motivovat, nabudit jeho zájem o probíranou látku a vhodným způsobem srovnat očekávání učitele s očekáváním studenta.</p>\n<h3>Kapitola 4: Jak studenti dosahují mistrovství?</h3>\n<p>Jelikož mistrovství, jakožto vysoký stupeň kompetence v oboru, má leccos společného s expertízou a expertní organizací znalostí, dovolím si zde snad poznamenat, že kapitola dvě a čtyři by si zasloužily být blíže u sebe, lépe propojené, už jen z toho důvodu, že autoři v obou kapitolách zmiňují stejný výzkum, ačkoli z něho vyvozují přeci jen odlišné důsledky.</p>\n<p>Kapitola čtyři ukazuje, že kromě hutně propojené a dobře organizované sítě znalostí je nedílnou součástí vysoké úrovně dovednosti řešit komplexní úkony (a to nejen ty akademicko-intelektuální) kompetence v tzv. <em>komponentních úkonech</em>.</p>\n<p>Tak například matematické úlohy z geometrie vyžadují kromě znalostí vzorců, také deduktivní myšlení, určitou schopnost vizualizovat si problém v mysli, obeznámenost se strategiemi, jak geometrické problémy řešit a v neposlední řadě také kombinaci všeho zmíněného. Právě ale plynulé řešení individuálních úkonů (komponent) je základem pro hlubší porozumění a učení.</p>\n<p>Autoři ale připomínají již zmíněný problém, kterému učitelé-experti při předávání znalostí musí čelit: dosáhnutí mistrovství začíná na pomyslné škále u <em>nevědomé kompetence, </em>pokračující <em>vědomou nekompetencí</em>, dále <em>vědomou kompetencí</em> a mistrovství je ztělesněno v <em>nevědomé kompetenci</em>. Jinak řečeno, veskrze pozitivní <em>nevědomá kompetence </em>učitelů-expertů je překážkou, jestliže chtějí své znalosti vysvětlovat a předávat. Proto kapitola opakovaně zdůrazňuje, že učitelé se musí naučit zpětně de-konstruovat své expertní znalosti na jednotlivé komponenty.</p>\n<p>Zdá se tak, že důkladné a izolované procvičování komponentních úkonů je zásadním krokem na cestě k mistrovství. Ne tak rychle, tvrdí autoři. Je to pouze prvním, důležitým krokem, řekněme přípravou pro druhý chod snažení, jež se nachází v uchopení komponentních dovedností a jejich následné <em>integrace</em> za účelem řešit komplexní úlohy. Kniha dále cituje řadu výzkumných prací, jež se věnují neméně důležité otázce: kdy přejít od cvičení komponentních dovedností k integraci. To se ukazuje jako nelehká otázka, závisející na povaze a kontextu problému.</p>\n<p>Je-li zmíněn kontext, mistrovství se prokazuje až tehdy, když student dokáže to, co se naučil, aplikovat napříč různými kontexty. Odborná literatura tuto dovednost pojmenovává jako schopnost <em>transferu</em>, který kniha (ale i literatura) dělí na blízký transfer (near transfer) a vzdálený transfer (far transfer). Blízkým transferem se myslí stejný či podobný kontext, kdežto vzdálený transfer popisuje schopnost aplikovat znalosti napříč velmi odlišnými kontexty.</p>\n<p>Jak jinak učitelé mohou podpořit studenty na jejich cestě k mistrovství? Jednou z dalších možností je uvědomění si, že vyřešení příkladu se častokrát nerovná jeho pochopení. Pokud si dle teorie kognitivní zátěže (cognitive load theory) samotné vyřešení problému vyžaduje na studentovi většinu jeho pozornosti a příliš vytíží jeho pracovní paměť, není pravděpodobné, že studentovi zbydou (s použitím informatické metafory) alokované prostředky k tomu, aby se během řešení soustředil na to, jak příklad řeší. Z tohoto důvodu se nabízí alternativa, kdy učitel poskytne studentovi již vyřešený příklad, čímž studentovi umožní, aby svou pozornost věnoval hlubšímu pochopení řešení, což spíše povede k osvojení si klíčových, abstraktních a tedy přenositelných principů.</p>\n<h3>Kapitola 5: Jaké praktiky a feedback zlepšují učení?</h3>\n<p>V páté kapitole kniha čerpá z kapitol předešlých. Navazuje na primárnost cílově orientovaného nácviku (goal-oriented practice), který je doplněn o analýzu a teorii zpětné vazby (feedbacku). Autoři definují nácvik (practice) jako „aktivitu využívající dovednosti a znalosti“ a feedback jako „informace o výkonu, jež usměrňuje budoucí chování“. Z informativní ilustrace na straně 126 čtenář vyčte, jak přesně cíle, nácvik, monitorování výkonu a zpětná vazba, specificky cílená zpětná vazba (targeted feedback), interagují v procesu učení: cíle řídí nácvik, ten vede k určitému výkonu, který je monitorován, cíle také určují, na jaké problémy se zpětná vazba zaměří, a nakonec cílená zpětná vazba, dokončující cyklus, řídí budoucí nácvik.</p>\n<p>V předchozí kapitole autoři analyzovali cíle především v kontextu vlastní motivace studentů, kdežto v této kapitole se zaměřují na cíle definované ze strany vyučujícího a požadavků kurzu. Dle autorů by učitelé měli své cíle artikulovat co nejjasněji, především tak, aby změny výkonů studentů u těchto cílů bylo možné vhodně monitorovat. Navíc by obtížnost dosáhnutí cílů, čili úkonů k nim vedoucím, měla následovat teorii ruského psychologa Lva Vygotského <em>Zónu nejbližšího vývoje</em>, kde úkony, aby stále ještě byly pro studenty motivující, mají být obtížné, že studenti je sice sami nedokáží vyřešit, ale s pomocí a vedením učitele toho schopni jsou. Správně nastavení obtížnosti úkonu je klíčové pro dosáhnutí stavu <em>flow</em><a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>, kdy „vědomí je zcela ponořeno v činnosti a [student z činnosti] zažívá pocit hlubokého potěšení“ (Tamtéž, s. 133).</p>\n<p>Třebaže předchozí odstavec se zaměřoval na kvalitativní aspekty výuky, autoři, citující výzkum, jasně deklarují, že bez mnoha hodin strávených na cvičení se studenti neobejdou. Zdůrazňují tímto kvantitativní aspekty učení označované souhrnně anglickým termínem „deliberate practice“, jenž se v češtině překládá také jako <em>deliberační/záměrná praxe</em><a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a>.</p>\n<p>V sekci zaměřené na zpětnou vazbu kapitola zmiňuje, že cílená zpětná vazba by měla jasně poukázat na to, co studentovi chybí, aby dosáhl požadovaného cíle; měla by být učitelem poskytnuta včas a tak často, aby se z ní mohl student ponaučit, začlenit ji do svého učení; a měla by poskytnout další příležitosti k zlepšení výkonu.</p>\n<h3>Kapitola 6: Proč jsou vývoj studenta a sociální klima kurzu důležité pro učení?</h3>\n<p>V šesté kapitole autoři nejpodrobněji rozpracovávají svůj holistický přístup k učení. Jak již bylo řečeno v třetí kapitole, cíle studentů jsou různorodé. Proto je nezbytné připustit, že studenti jsou nejen intelektuální, ale i sociální a emoční bytosti a právě tyto dimenze dotváří kompletní klima, v němž probíhá proces učení. Argumentů, proč by učitele měli tyto „soft“ aspekty učení zajímat, je hned několik. Autoři například zmiňují, že během doby univerzitního studia, pozitivní přírůstky v oblasti studentova sociálního a emočního vývoje jsou při srovnání s intelektuálním růstem znatelně vyšší (Tamtéž, s. 157). I kdyby učitele primárně zajímal pouze intelektuální vývoj, autoři argumentují, že se nelze vyhnout tomu, aby sociální a emoční aspekty ovlivňovali studentův výkon. Zde si myslím, že ačkoli jistě existují vyučující, kteří se necítí být z různých důvodů kompetentní k tomu, aby ovlivňovali sociální či emoční vývoj studenta, měli by se ujistit, že jejich chování a praktiky, jsou přinejmenším neutrální, co se tohoto vývoje týče, neboť zatímco pozitivní sociální klima kurzu stimuluje učení, negativní klima učení brání. A jaké že praktiky vedou k pozitivnímu sociálnímu klimatu kurzu?</p>\n<p>Sekce kapitoly vysvětlující vývoj studenta se opírá o Chickeringův Model, který „se snaží systematicky pojmout všechny vývojové změny, které student prožívá během univerzitních let“ (Tamtéž, s. 160). Model má sedm dimenzí, které autoři nazývají vektory: budování kompetence (intelektuální, fyzické, interpersonální), ovládání emocí, rozvíjení autonomie, tvorba vlastní identity, uvolnění interpersonálních vztahů, rozvoj smyslu, a nakonec rozvoj integrity. Všechny vektory jsou navzájem provázané a teprve jejich součet určuje výsledný výkon studenta.</p>\n<p>Na výkonu se rovněž netriviálně podílí klima kurzu, v kapitole definované jako intelektuální, sociální, emoční a fyzický prostor interakce mezi studenty, obsahem kurzu, vyučující i dalšími orgány školy, se kterými student přijde do styku. Klima kurzu se pohybuje na spektru od zcela marginalizujícího až po zcela inkluzivní. Citovaný výzkum varuje, že přes veškeré pokroky na cestě k větší inkluzivitě ve vzdělávání zůstává většina kurzů implicitně marginalizující. v mnoha případech si totiž vyučující ani neuvědomuje, že jeho chování k marginalizaci vede: z fiktivní, přesto názorného příběhu na začátku kapitoly se dozvídáme, že učitel chtěl zamezit stereotypizaci žen v muži dominovaném oboru elektrotechniky tím, že jim poskytuje pomoc a vedení nad rámec standardní výuky a šetří dívky tím, že je během výuky nevyvolává. Jakkoli ctnostné byly jeho úmysly, vedly nakonec u studentek k nižšímu sebevědomí, kdežto u chlapců vyvolaly pocit nespravedlnosti.</p>\n<p>Stereotypizaci, přesněji koncept <em>ohrožení stereotypem</em> (stereotype threat)<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a>, jakožto snížení výkonu ze strachu stereotypem zasažené skupiny (ženy, etnické či sexuální menšiny, apod.), že bude hodnocena skrze optiku stereotypu, je jeden z konceptů, které se podílejí na marginalizujícím klimatu. Negativní vliv na motivaci a výkon má ale např. tón a verbálního a non-verbálního vyjadřování, nevstřícnost orgánů školy nebo obsah probírané látky, který dogmaticky bude razit jednu správnou odpověď a perspektivu tam, kde je možná pluralita názorů a různé perspektivy (např. humanitní vědy).</p>\n<p>Přes veškerou snahu ale nelze vždy všechny perspektivy zajistit a uspokojit. Pro případy, kdy učitel může očekávat konflikt a emocionální reakce, je vhodné předem jasně stanovit pravidla diskuze, které by měly zamezit emocionálním zkratům tím, že vyzdvihnou empiricismus a racionalitu tak, že přímo do hodnocení učitel zahrne požadavek (i možné zvýhodnění) argumentace na základě faktů a rozumu. Kapitola poskytuje mnoho dalšího hodnotného materiálu a strategií, jak nakládat s (nejen pro holistické pojetí učení) důležitými dovednostmi, které jsou až příliš často dehonestovány jako „soft“.</p>\n<h3>Kapitola 7: Jak se studenti stávají sebe-řízenými studujícími?</h3>\n<p>Sebe-řízené (self-directed) studium znamená opravdovou autonomii v intelektuálním vývoji studenta, od kterého se žádá, aby byl schopen „zhodnotit požadavky úkonu, zhodnotit své vlastní dovednosti a znalosti, naplánovat postup řešení, monitorovat svůj pokrok, a nakonec podle potřeby své strategie měnit“ (Tamtéž, s. 191). Schopnost aplikovat tyto strategie, spadající pod kategorii <em>meta-kognitivních dovedností</em>, jinak řečeno „přemýšlení o přemýšlení“, tvoří jednu z hlavních podmínek úspěšného zvládnutí přechodu ze střední školy na vyšší úrovně vzdělání i pro profesní život, kde strategie mechanického učení (rote learning) je neadekvátní pro hlubší pochopení konceptů.</p>\n<p>Teprve v této poslední kapitole kladou autoři vedle sebe pojmy učení a inteligence, což je vztah, který by čtenář vzhledem k povaze tématu očekával dříve. Předcházející principy by totiž ztrácely smysl, pokud by jakákoli intervence v učení ztroskotala na fixní povaze inteligence determinující veškerý výkon studenta. Kapitola bohužel v tomto případě nezabíhá do hloubky a necituje relevantní výzkum vlivu inteligence na učení. Z předchozích kapitol popisující mistrovství a expertní znalosti se čtenář dozvídá, že nikoli inteligence, ale hlavně organizace znalostí, cvičení komponentních znalostí a jejich integrace jsou tím, co dělí experta od ostatních. I proto se čtenář nediví, že ve stejném duchu se nese tato kapitola: není to inteligence jako taková, ale <em>percepce</em> studentů, jakou roli inteligence podle nich v učení má, co zásadně ovlivňuje výkon. Kniha skutečně cituje řadu výzkumů, které potvrzují, že pokud studenti věří, že úsilí vede ke zlepšení nehledě na inteligenci, jsou více motivováni se věnovat tréninku svých meta-kognitivních znalostí, což konsekventně vede ke zlepšení jejich výkonu.</p>\n<p>Nejdůležitější poznatek kapitoly je tak ten, že minimálně na vysokoškolské úrovni, kde inteligence studentů dosahuje určitého bodu, plánování a monitorování práce u studentů jednoznačně vede ke zlepšení výsledků, a proto by tyto meta-kognitivní dovednosti měly být dle autorů součástí kurikula a explicitně vyučovány.</p>\n<h2>Závěr</h2>\n<p>Autoři knihy představují kompilát velkého množství výzkumu, který syntetizují do přehledné formy sedmi principů, jejichž aplikace určitě přispěje ke zkvalitnění výuky. Holistický a kontextuální pohled na proces učení je zcela na místě, zvláště v době, kdy inkluze a diverzita jsou aktivní témata ve společnosti. Kniha působí velmi kompaktně, což ve většině případů považuji za kladnou vlastnost této publikace, přestože jsem si povšiml, že u některých témat se nabízelo, aby je kniha probrala pohromadě. Některé z mého pohledu zásadní témata naopak byla upozaděna, což ale nepřičítám nedbalosti či nekompetentnosti autorů, nýbrž vybranému formátu knihy, který si nekladl za cíl být vyčerpávající analytickou prací, ale praktickým úvodem a průvodcem současného stavu poznání v akademických oborech, jež mají co dočinění s kognitivními, ale i socio-kulturními aspekty učení. Kniha je napsána srozumitelným a čtivým stylem, bez zbytečného žargonu, což jistě potěší populárnější spektrum čtenářů, ale i čtenáře českého. A z tohoto důvodu si troufám říct, že kniha naplnila záměr, který si na začátku vytyčila.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a> Koncept, který do psychologie zavedl Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> Překlad do češtiny není zatím v literatuře zcela ustálený viz PÍŠOVÁ, <em>Teorie a výzkum expertnosti v učitelské profesi</em>, s. 19</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> Pohled na ohrožení stereotypem např. v relativně vzácně česky psaném příspěvku viz SMETÁČKOVÁ, Fenomén stereotype threat a jeho vliv na školní výkony</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Informace o knize</h2>\n<p>Název knihy: How learning works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching (Foreword by Richard E.

Heidegger text prezentoval v roce 1946 v rámci přednášky na půdě Bavorské akademie umění (Bayerische Akademie der Schönen Künste). Přestože byl text psán rok po konci druhé světové války, nenajdeme v něm o válce žádné přímé zmínky. Z filosofického, ale i čistě pragmatického hlediska mi to dává smysl. Technika, jak se v textu dozvídáme, je něco, co předchází i teoretické zkoumání přírody. Z tohoto důvodu je tak důležité se nenechat zlákat trendy a momentálním použitím slova “technika” i techniky samotné. Neznamená to, že by Heidegger zcela opomenul nebezpečí, které jde ruku v ruce s technikou. Jenže tak činí až na konci své eseje a má k tomu rigorózně připravenou argumentaci, která by byla platná před i po válce, právě proto, že nevyužívá tehdejšího, jakkoli strašného kontextu. Univerzálnost a snaha „jít k jádru slov a jejich významům“ je mimo jiné stěžejní téma celé eseje.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tuto archeologickou stezku po významech slov Heidegger podstupuje s předvědčením, že během staletí se původní vyznam slov vytratil, což nám činí problémy, když se snažíme dopátrat bytnosti věcí, v případě této eseje bytnosti techniky. I proto je esej plna etymologické analýzy, sahající až ke kořenům západní civilizace, k významům slov tak, jak byly používané v antickém Řecku.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zběhlí čtenáři a následovníci Heideggera si povšimnou, že tento text je v porovnání s ostatními díly tohoto filosofa nezvykle krátký a snad i méně hutný. To ale neznamená, že je text jednoduchý. Používání cizích slov a ke konci i básnický jazyk autora z této eseje činí dílo, jehož náročnost odpovídá cíli, který si autor vytyčil: </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">„tážeme-li se po technice, chtěli bychom si k ní zjednat </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">svobodný vztah</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Vztah je svobodný, když se v něm náš pobyt (Dasein) otevírá bytnosti techniky“. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Těm, které náročnost eseje neodradí, nabízí Heidegger unikátní pohled na techniku. Po přečtení a pochopení si v Heideggerovi najdou inspiraci pro své chápání nejen techniky, ale i teorie designu, a dokonce i epistemologie.. O své interpretaci Heideggera napíšu ale příště. V tomto blog postu bych rád „pouze“ představil své poznámky.

Tyto pohledy pojmenovává Heidegger jako pohled instrumentální a pohled antropologický. Co je ale instrumentálnost? Tato otázka vede autora k analýze </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kauzality</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Tu analyzuje na pozadí Aristotelových čtyř příčin: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">příčina látková (causa materialis) — materiál, ze kterého je předmět vytvořen</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">příčina tvarová (causa formalis) — vlastní tvar předmětu</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">příčina účinná (causa efficiens) — ten, kdo předmět zhotovil</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">příčina účelová (causa finalis) — za jakým účelem byl předmět zhotoven</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger postupuje ve zkoumání instrumentálnosti o jednu úroveň níže a zaměřuje se na to, co je to kauzalita. U té varuje, abychom kauzalitu nechápali jako příčinu, jako to, co něco způsobuje. Co totiž Římané nazývali </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">causa (padat, dopadnout)</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, bylo u Řeků </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aition</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, tedy to, co něco jiného zaviňuje. Člověk, například řemeslník (nebo v Heideggerově příkladu stříbrník), který zhotovuje předmět jako </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">causa efficiens</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, jak Heidegger zde zdůrazňuje, zaviňuje výsledný předmět nikoli děláním, ale </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">promýšlením</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a spojováním těch ostatních třech způsobů zavinění. Pro promýšlení řekové používali slovo </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">legein, logos</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, termín vycházející z </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">apophainesthai</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, což znamená vynášet najevo, vyjevovat, v angličtině pak „to reveal“.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zaviňování nesmíme chápat v moderním, morálním smyslu, ale v původním smyslu Řeků, kdy </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aition</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> znamená „být zodpovědný za“. Dále Heidegger přichází se zásadní interpretací </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aition</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: zmíněné čtyři „příčiny“ (zde již skutečně v uvozovkách) zodpovídají za konečný předmět, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nechávají jej vstupovat do bytostné přítomnosti</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vpouštějí ho sem</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nechávají ho dokončit svůj příchod</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (s. 12). Heidegger píše:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">„V čem se tedy ale odehrává souhra oněch čtyř způsobů dopouštění? Tyto čtyři způsoby nechávají to, co ještě není přítomno, přicházet do přítomnosti“. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toto </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dopuštění</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, které něco přiměje, aby se z ne-přítomnosti stalo přítomné, nazývá Platón v dialogu Symposion </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">poiesis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, respektive </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">poskytnutí výskytu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (her-vor-bringen, v angličtině bringing-forth).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Máme dva druhy poskytnutí výskytu: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">poiesis </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">physis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Poiesis je poskytování výskytu někým, něčím (např. řemeslníkem), přestože </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">poiesis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> neznamená pouze řemeslnou, básnickou nebo uměleckou činnost.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Physis na druhé straně je poskytování výskytu od přírody, samo od sebe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jak se poskytování výskytu, v přírodě i v řemeslníkovi, děje? Zde podává Heidegger vyhýbavou odpověď. Zmiňuje veskrze synonymní slova a fráze: poskytování výskytu jako:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vcházení do zjevu</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vynášení ze skrytosti do ne-skrytosti</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dochází k němu, pokud skryté přechází do ne-skrytého</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toto přecházení </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">probleskuje</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> v tom, co nazýváme </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">odkrývání</span></i></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pro odkrývání mají Řekové slovo </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aletheia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Římané veritas, Heidegger konstatuje, že my říkáme pravda, správnost představování. (s. 12) </span><b>V odkrývání se shromažďují čtyři způsoby dopuštění (</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4 příčiny, neboť participují na odkrývání předmětu</span><b>). Technika jako instrument, jako prostředek, je jeden ze způsobů odkrývání</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><b>Technika je oblast odkrývání. Oblast pravdy.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger tímto dokončuje analýzu instrumentální povahy techniky a kauzality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger dále nabízí analýzu samotného slova technika. To pochází z řeckého </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">technikon</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, což znamená to, co patří k </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">techné</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Techné je nejen řemeslo, ale i umění a myšlenky. Techné patří k odkrývání, takže k poiesis, je poietické (nikoli physis), protože se neodkrývá samo od sebe, ale někým, něčím (např. člověkem). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Od dob Platóna bylo techné spojeno se slovem epistémé. Obě slova jsou jména pro poznání v nejširším smyslu, pro expertní znalost, pro poznání, </span><b>které věci otevírá a odkrývá</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><i>Proti tomuto určení oblasti bytnosti techniky lze namítnout, že sice snad platilo pro řecké myšlení a hodí se v příznivém případě na techniku rukodělnou, nehodí se však na moderní techniku strojovou (s. 15)</i></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger uznává, že dosavadní analýza mohla fungovat pro řemeslo, ale jak se to má s moderní technikou, která je založená na poznatcích z exaktních věd? Je využívání exaktních věd (teoretické, aplikované fyziky) tím, co odděluje moderní techniku od té z dob, kdy vrcholem techniky byly řemesla? Heidegger nesouhlasí, protože </span><b>technika umožnila moderní vědy</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, bez techniky by moderní vědy nemohly fungovat, ověřovat výsledky, atd. Což znamená, že technika je něco, co existuje před vědou.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V čem se moderní technika </span><b>liší, je fakt, že její odkrývání není poiesis, ale VYMÁHÁNÍ </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(s. 14), to požaduje od přírody, aby byla vymáhána, aby dodávala energii. Toto vymáhání na přírodě je forma </span><b>dobývání</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><b>vymáhání odkrývání</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Celá příroda se stává </span><b>použitelným stavem (v angličtině standing-reserve)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Bestand</span><b>, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">je zasažena vymáhajícím odkrýváním.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Člověk se ale sám stává použitelným stavem (standing-reserve). Dělník, dřevorubec jsou součástí průmyslu, jsou na průmyslu závislí a průmysl je využívá jako použitelný stav pro výdělek. Že je toto nebezpečné, to zmíní Heidegger později.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vymáhání odkrývání činí samozřejmě člověk (má pozn.: Heidegger je silně antropocentrický?). Na druhou stranu je i na člověku něco vymáháno, a to právě jeho nutnost vymáhat odkrývání na přírodě. A co že člověka k tomu žene? Heidegger to pojmenovává </span><b>Gestell (v angličtině En-framing)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, ustanovující zjednávání. (má pozn.: slovo Gestell činí mnohým problémy; nejen, že Heidegger používá Gestell ve zcela novém smyslu, nedává si tu práci, aby tento nový [svůj] smysl řádně vysvětlil)</span><b>. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger Gestell popisuje jako:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">„onen vymáhavý nárok, který člověka soustřeďuje k tomu, aby to, co se odkrývá, zjednával jako použitelný stav zásob“ (s. 21)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V anglické verzi je „to, co se odkrývá“ přeloženo jako „self-revealing“, takže můžeme říci, že člověk využívá (vymáhá) moderní technikou to, co je odkrýváno jako </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">physis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Autor poznamenává, že Gestell v němčině obvykle znamená podstavec, podvozek, stojan na knihy. Z anglického překladu Enframing také Gestell chápeme jako rámování, rámec, rám, strukturu)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gestell je součástí odkrývání, tedy bytnosti techniky, ale není nic technického (proto Heidegger může jako filosof seriózně zkoumat bytnost techniky bez toho, aby měl jakékoli technické vzdělání, tzn. nemusí být třeba inženýrem).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gestell člověka nabádá, aby odkrýval/vymáhal přírodu jako použitelnou zásobu. (má pozn.: To se ale děje jen tehdy, když tato zásoba je kvantifikovatelná, jinak řečeno, je možné tyto zásoby pojmout aparátem současné teoretické fyziky. Co není kalkulovatelné, nelze odkrývat, a tak vlastně [pro člověka] neexistuje. Heidegger o tom ještě bude mluvit, ale tento fyzikalismus, který jsme jako lidstvo nasadili na přírodu, nejspíše ruku v ruce přináší problémy a nebezpečí Gestellu — chápání a jednání s přírodou jako s něčím, co je tu pro nás, abychom to použili).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gestell, jak vyplývá z textu, není jeden a jediný způsob odkrývání, a tudíž člověk nemusí odkrývat to, co je v přírodě, jako použitelnou zásobu. V tom má člověk svobodu, která dle Heideggera spravuje to, co je prosvětlené, odkryté. Svoboda je v tomto blízká pravdě, neboť jak svoboda i pravda se dějí na (má interpretace) pomyslné hraně odkrývání: odkrývání osvětluje a zároveň odkrývá.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gestell je nebezpečí, protože nutí člověka odkrývat pouze to, co dokáže (má interpretace) </span><b>škatulkovat</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> do konceptů a matematických vzorců, bez ohledu na to, zda je to pravdivé či nikoli. Pokud chápeme techniku jako instrument, nevyhneme se kauzalitě. Pokud porozumíme kauzalitě (příčinám) jako způsobům, kterými přichází věci z ne-existence, ze skrytosti do existence, ne-skrytosti, porozumíme tomu, že bytností techniky je způsob, jakým odkrýváme svět.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger nabádá, že se můžeme tomuto nebezpečí vyvarovat, pokud začneme odkrývat přírodu tak, jak to dělali Řekové, odkrývat jako </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">techné</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, jako instrumentálnost techniky a jako umění, jako </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">poiesis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Pro Heideggera mělo umění v antickém Řecku jednotící prvek, když integrovalo všechy aspekty života do jednoho celku. Umění je pro Heideggera způsob odkrývání, který nám dokáže zprostředkovat pravdu bez toho, aniž by byla zatížena požadavkem po měřitelnosti, kvantifikovatelnosti, neboť těmito požadavky se umění zajímá obecně méně než technika jako Gestell, technika jako vymáhání přírody.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nezůstat u Gestellu, ale zkoumat a kriticky hodnotit náš vztah k samotné bytnosti odkrývání, ke světu. Neboť tázání, jak píše Heidegger, je zbožnost myšlení.</span></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Prolog: Esej Otázka techniky byla původně psaná pro publikum, u kterého autor nemohl počítat s filosofickým vzděláním.

Jistě, tato univerzita patří ve většině svých oborů ke špičce, a to nejen v technických oborech, vždyť do dnešního dne MIT poskytuje zázemí jednomu z nejvlivnějších teoretických lingvistů 20. století, Noamovi Chomskému. Není tak překvapením, že i jejich designové obory budou patřit k tomu nejlepšímu, co lze momentálně na světě studovat. A je tomu již nějakou tu dobu. Vzpomenete si na projekt Aspen Movie Map z roku 1978? Jednalo se o revoluční hypermediální systém, který zmapoval město Aspen v americkém Coloradu pomocí videokamer připevněných na automobilu. Uživatel pak takto zmapované město mohl virtuálně procházet v příslušném programu, a dokonce po kliknutí na vybrané budovy se mu zobrazily o daném místě informace. Jednotlivé scény města sice nebyly kontinuální, ale i tak se v mnoha aspektech jednalo o prekurzor Google Street View. A to prosím o několik dekád.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Současné úspěchy MIT Media Labu jsou tak početné, že i při jejich detailním vyjmenování bych na některé důležité zapomněl. Proto se uchýlím k těm, jež jsou mi nejbližší: Dr. Hugh Herr, který vede výzkum v biomechatronice, konkrétně tvorbu robotických protéz a wearables, jejichž cílem není pouze navrátit ztracené lidské schopnosti (sám Dr. Herr je uživatelem svých protéz, neb přišel o nohy), ale také, neméně ambiciózním, požadavkem kladeným na výzkumnou skupina Dr. Herra je lidské schopnosti rozšiřovat, jít za to, co je standardně považováno u člověka za možné. Jako druhou ukázku úspěchů Media Labu zmíním Nexi Oxman. Ta se pohybuje v šedé, a proto fascinující zóně mezi technologií, designem a biologií. Pro interakční designéry je ale z Media Labu nejzajímavější výzkumná skupina pojmenovaná jako Tangible Media. O co se jedná?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adjektivum „tangible“ lze přeložit jako hmatatelné, hmotné, uchopitelné. V Tangible Media se tak věnují komputaci a interakcím, na které si doslova je možné sáhnout. Hlavní tezí skupiny, vedené Hiroshi Ishiiem, je že lidé se vyvinuli s mnoha dovednostmi, které ale v současném klasickém paradigmatu interakce s grafickým uživatelským interfacem nejsou používáné. Cílem by tak mělo být, aspoň podle Ishiia i dalších, abychom odstranili onu dualitu fyzický/digitální tak, abych přechod mezi nimi byl plynulý, realistický a na interakce bohatý. Anebo slovy skupiny: je čas na posun od renderovaných bitů na bitmapové obrazovce digitálního světa k uchopitelným programovatelným bitům světa fyzického. To by vše bylo krásné, kdyby tu ale nebyl “elephant in the room”, který tuto vizi číní pokud ne irelevantní, tak minimálně ji odsouvá na okraj zájmu, coby jakýsi umělecko-technologický experiment. Tím slonem v předsíni je virtuální realita. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nechápejte mě špatně, umění a experiment jsou nesmírně důležité, neboť rozšiřují naše epistemické horizonty, nabízejí pohled na svět prostřednictvým nových optik a tyto pohledy mají často kaskádovitý, rekurzivní dopad na znalost toho, co “jest”, protože nová optika vrhá nové světlo i na již existující, staré, známé. Naopak, určitým způsobem jsem zcela pro sloučení fyzického a digitálního. Jen si myslím, že k tomuto spojení se naskytá mnohem příhodnější médium, zmiňovaná virtuální realita.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software má hned několik vlastností. Pro mě tou nejpodivnější je ale fakt, že software je jediný prostor v našem vesmíru, kde neplatí fyzikální zákony (na matematickém pochopení singularity černých děr se prý pracuje a existují teorie, které hlásají, že fyzikální zákony platí i v černých dírách). Je úplně nepodstatné, že v reálné, fyzické podobě je člověk malý, široký, ošklivý, ve virtuální realitě může být atletem, miss světa, anebo nic z toho a může nabrat formu motýla nebo transparentní želatiny. Chce s rodinou v létě na Jupiter? Chce rodinu bez toho, aby musela žena projít porodními bolestmi? Není problém, stačí si zvolit vhodné proměnné a konstanty a dítě se vygeneruje v následujícím framu scény. Pokud by snad chtěla žena porodní bolesti zachovat, není problém. Ale proč bolest nesdílet s mužem, nebo kosatkou či s tím motýlem, nebo s kým, že dítě bude mít? Vždyť ve virtuální realitě může rodit i muž. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Je snad zřejmé, kam tím vším mířím. Spojit fyzické a digitální je úctyhodný počin, není ale ultimátním cílem fyzické odstranit úplně, respektive je simulovat ve virtuální realitě? Zatímco překonávat fyzikální zákony v reálném světě je namáhavé, často i finančně, ve VR je to otázkou změn několika parametrů simulace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook, Google, Microsoft, všichni velcí hráči se předhánějí v tom, kdo využije virtuální realitu nejlépe. Virtuální realita má nekonečný potenciál limitovaný pouze lidskou představivostí a v tuto chvíli ještě stále hrubým výpočetním výkonem a kapacitami sítě. Svět kráčí, ne svět sprintuje k virtuální realitě. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I proto se mi zdá, že práce Tangible Media při MIT, jakkoli umělecky cenná a “cool”,  je tak trochu výzkumem v zemi nikoho. Ano, lidé touží po splynutí pixelů a bitů, jenže vyžadují nikoli symbiotický vztah, ale destruktivní událost, vyhlazení atomů a nastolení diktatury pixelů, neboli bitů. Takový svět, více reálný než realita sama, přinese skutečnou emancipaci lidstva. Otázkou pak zbývá, zda to bude svět radikálně nový, nebo pouze nalezení ztracené informace ze stromu poznání: při četbě myšlenek teoretické fyzika Johna Archibalda Wheelera nás napadne, že v takové virtuální realitě již dávno žijeme. Ale o tom zas jindy.</span></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Screenshot z youtube videa Amazing Technology Invented By MIT &#8211; Tangible Media (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvtfD_rJ2hE) Mají-li interakční designéři jakýsi pomyslný svatý chrám, ke kterému se každý den obrací, nebo aspoň tehdy, když mají klid od svých na kreativitu suchých komerčních projektů, napadá mě jedno zcela nekontroverzní místo: Media Lab při americké MIT.

Jako nástroj pro samotnou analýzu jsme si vybrali open-source vizualizační program Gephi, který je postaven na javovské NetBeans platformě. Z té dědí několik dobrých i špatných vlastností: modularitu, velkou sada funkcí, občasnou nestabilitu a v neposlední řadě GUI, které nebylo navrženo jako nativní pro specifické OS, což může znamenat pro mnohé uživatele ne zcela intuitivní ovládání. Autoři Gephi se dále chlubí, že se jedná o software, který je v dané kategorii Photoshopem vizualizace dat. Nechám na čtenáři, je-li to z marketingového hlediska dobrý slogan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Téma bylo libovolné, a tak jsem se rozhodl zjisti, jak lidé na sociální síti Twitter reagují na události, které nejen na druhé straně Atlantiku zaměstnávají lidem většinu volného času: prezidentské volby v USA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Potom, co jsem měl téma vybrané, stál jsem před mnohem složitější otázkou, která měla rozhodnout o tom, zda následující hodiny práce budou buď pouze bezúčelným, nebo prospěšným hraním si na datového analytika — otázkou, jakým způsobem naložím s daty, jaká data vůbec budu potřebovat, co v těchto datech budu hledat, a zdali je teoreticky možné to z těchto dat získat. Jinak řečeno, vědět, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">co </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">přesně v datech hledat, je v mnoha případech důležitější než vědět, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">jak</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> něčeho dosáhnout. Ve skutečnosti jsou tyto otázky od sebe neoddělitelné, neboť se navzájem informují. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tak například výborné doménové znalosti jsou dle současných teorií kreativity jedním z předpokladů pro to, aby člověk přišel na něco </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nového</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">užitečného</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funkčního</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, což jsou mimochodem vlastnosti, jež každý kreativní výstup musí splňovat. Doménové znalosti jsou samozřejmě nutným předpokladem pro eminentní výkon v každé lidské činnosti. A jsou to právě doménové znalosti, které z datové analytiky činí mnohem více, než jen aplikaci rigorózních matematických metod na sadu dat; datová analytika vyžaduje i ony znalosti, které akademická obec považuje za </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">soft</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: povědomí o společnosti, kultuře a momentálním kontextu oblasti, kterou budu zkoumat, tedy jakési humanitní, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">soft-science</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> povědomí. Mojí zcela spekulativní hypotézou vysvětlující, proč je tak málo kvalitních datových analytiků, je právě ne-častý požadavek být dobrým matematikem i humanistou zároveň, mít informaticko-matematické vzdělání spojené s dávkou zdravého povědomí, co se děje za okny ve společnosti, pak i znalosti sociologie, antropologie, ba dokonce literatury či filosofie, a nedejbože i nových médií. Chce to poetu i šachistu, vědce i umělce.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dobrá, jak jsem naložil s tímto </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem\">wicked problémem</a></span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, kde existuje mnoho možných řešení, kde odpověď neosciluje mezi binárním ANO-NE, ale je spíše na spojité stupnici vhodnosti? Jakou otázku jsem se rozhodl prozkoumat?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter je vhodnou platformou pro textovou analýzu, především díky tomu, že příspěvky jsou na základě své limitace 140 znaků konzistentní, což analýzu zjednodušuje. Kromě samotného příspěvku, jenž zde označím za </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vlastní příspěvek</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, obsahuje twitterový příspěvek i text plnící funkci popisu </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vlastního příspěvku</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, jedná se tak o meta-data. Za ty se považuje kombinace znaku zavináč <em>@ + jméno uživatele</em>, kterého se </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vlastní příspěvek </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nějakým způsobem týká, a samozřejmě také <em>znak # + libovolný text</em>, tedy kombinace dnes již hojně označovaná za hashtag.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Protože hashtagy jsou častokrát používány nikoli jako zcela nerelevatní, nesouvisející řetězec znaků, ale jako meta-data, jež doplňují <em>vlastní </em></span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">příspěvek </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">o užitečné kontextuální informace pomáhající čtenářům v porozumění twitterového příspěvku, rozhodl jsem se využít právě hashtagů k tomu, abych se dobral pohledu na to, jak lidé reagují, píší, a tedy přemýšlí o prezidentských kampaních mnou vybraných kandidátů. Jak přesně by hashtagy ale měly být k tomu užitečné, a co vlastně hashtag znamená?  </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sociální web 2.0, folksonomie a hashtagy</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Etymologicky a lingvisticky vzato, slovo hashtag vzniklo kombinací slov „hash“ a „tag“. Zatímco slovo hash referuje nekomplikovaně ke znaku křížku či mřížky #, druhá polovina této sloučeniny, slovo tag, je mnohem zajímavější, především proto, že tagy představovaly důležitý aspekt v transformaci Webu na sociální platformu, které se souhrnně začalo říkat Web 2.0. Termín dříve tak často užívaný, že jej mnozí odsuzovali jako pouhý marketingový buzzword, přesto se jednalo a stále jedná o užitečné označení Webu, kdy nové technologie, nové přístupy v tvorbě webových stránek a aplikací daly vzniknout tendencím a projektům, jež se znatelně lišily od toho, co po zavedení verze 2.0 nazýváme Webem 1.0. Shrnutí všech významných změn popsal vlivný článek </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Web 2.0</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> od Tima O’Reillyho, proto se zde omezím pouze na to, co se přímo týká tagů, respektive hashtagů: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">folksonomii</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a na to, co O’Reilly nazval „zapřáhnutím kolektivní inteligence“.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ačkoli se to může zdát z dnešního pohledu nepředstavitelné, platforma Webu nebyla vždy tak interaktivní, responzivní a uživatelům otevřená. Je to ale pochopitelné, neboť kreativita tvůrců webových stránek vždy šla ruku v ruce s tím, co umožňovala technologie. Tak například webový designér nemohl při svém návrhu webových stránek přemýšlet nad tím, že jeho web bude mít plno fotografického materiálu, až do doby, kdy v roce 1993 přišel na trh prohlížec Mosaic, který jako první umožňoval, aby se grafické elementy (např. fotografie, grafické prvky uživatelského rozhraní) nezobrazovaly v novém okně, ale přímo uvnitř obsahu webové stránky. Mosaic lze tak považovat za webový prohlížeč, který vůbec poprvé umožnil, aby se Web priblížil grafickému designu, čímž zároveň vznikla poptávka po web designérech, informačních architektech, tedy profesionálech, kteří dokázali tyto nové a úžasné grafické možnosti vhodně zformovat tak, aby webová stránka umožnila návštěvníkům rychle a vhodně poskytnout informace i <em>zážitky</em>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S příchodem skriptovacích jazyků na straně klienta jako byl Javascript, prohlížečů, i použití vhodnějších programovacích jazyků a databází, a hlavně podpory funkcionalit ze strany dodavatelů webových prohlížečů, vznikaly webové projekty, které umožňovaly nejen bohatší interakce, ale také zapojení svých uživatelů do tvorby webového obsahu. Zatímco dříve webové stránky byly statické a sloužily jako o něco dražší náhrada tištěných firemních brožurek (teoretička a designérka Rachel Hinman takové webové stránky skutečně nazvala brochureware), nyní webové stránky se staly dynamickým prostorem, kde uživatel nebyl pouze návštěvník, ale i spoluautor. Tato sociální revoluce platformy Webu také znamenala, že Web začal konečně využívat své největší přednosti: hypertextu a hyperlinků. O’Reilly ve svém článku poznamenává, že:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">„Hyperlinkování je základem webu. Když uživatelé přidávají nový obsah a nové stránky, začnou být svázané s [předchozí] strukturou webu tím, že další uživatelé tento obsah objeví a odkazují na něj. Tak jako se synapse tvoří v mozku a spojení se stávají opakováním či intenzitou silnější, rostou propojení webu organicky jako výsledek kolektivní aktivity všechny uživatelů webu“ (O&#8217;Reilly, 2005)</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mezi prototypické představitele sociální revoluce platformy Webu řadí O’Reilly kromě Wikipedie a Ebay také dříve populární projekt na tvorbu záložek (bookmarks) <em>del.icio.us</em> a stále aktivní, dnes již pod Yahoo spadající <em>Flickr</em>. Oba projekty popularizovaly koncept „tagování“, tedy umožňovaly uživatelům označit přidané fotografie nebo záložky krátkými slovy, jejichž výběr byl zcela v rukou uživatelů, jejich kreativity, vzdělání či znalostí. Tato uživatelsky definovaná klasifikace položek si vynesla označení </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">folksonomy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, jež vzniklo spojením slov </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">folk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (lidový) a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">taxonomy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kromě toho, že sociální funkcionality webových projektů a tagy outsourcují generování obsahu a jeho kategorizaci k uživatelům, čímž mimo jiné demokratizují Web jako takový, poskytují také mimořádný pohled do myšlení jednotlivých uživatelů, jelikož při definování tagů uživatel sice může být ovlivněn momentálními konvencemi a populárností vybraných tagů, ale jinak mu standardně na současných populárních webových projektech umožňující (hash)tagování teoreticky nebrání nic, aby tagoval dle libosti. V praktické rovině ale uživatel přeci jen volí tagování svých fotek nebo zpráv podle toho, aby co nejlépe využil celé podstaty tagování: krátké komentování toho, o čem položka pojednává, co vyobrazuje. Určité tagy se mohou stát natolik populárními, že vytváří určitý souvislý příběh, to lze vidět často na současných sociálních sítí jako Twitter, který dynamicky vytváří seznam právě nejpoužívanějších tagů. Jejich popularita často koresponduje s nějakou významnou socio-kulturní událostí jako například vyhlašování vítězů filmových cen Oscar, politický skandál, válečný konflikt či přírodní neštěstí. Takové použití (hash)tagů je ale již popisem zcela aktuální situace: Twitter ale (hash)tagy nenabízel ihned po svém spuštění a po zavedení předpokládal, že budou využívané trochu jinak.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Twitter a hashtag</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Když byl Twitter v roce 2006 spuštěn, nenabízel „žádný technický ani sociálních mechanismus, který umožňoval odpovědět jinému uživateli, organizovat pospolu tweety, či indikovat, že tweet je součástí širšího tématu.“ (Highfield, 2015) Teprve v roce 2007 navrhl Chris Messina, toho času pracovník Google, ucelenou představu toho, jak by Twitter mohl využít znaku „#“ ke seskupování twitter zpráv. Messina se inspiroval u protokolu a chatu IRC (Internet Relay Chat), kde se symbol křížku využívá pro označení kanálů a témat, tedy pro stejnou funkci, kterou chtěl Messina zavést pro síť Twitter. Jeden z důvodů, proč se hashtag (hash + tag) rychle uchytil, byl malý nárok na změny stávající infrastruktury Twitteru; hashtag dále nevyžadoval po uživatelích technické znalosti kódování a vyhledávání. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Messina, 2007)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zavedení hashtagu tak původně sloužilo pro seskupení twitter zpráv podle stejného tématu. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Scott, 2015) Někteří akademici zkoumající sociální sítě si ale povšimli, že již mezi lety 2009 a 2010</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> toto puristické využití hashtagů se rychle změnilo v „neřízenou střelu“ (went rogue). Další tvrdí, že hashtagy přestaly sloužit pro organizaci obsahu a proměnily se v „lingvistický nádor“. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Vosper, 2016)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jinak řečeno, hashtag se z utilitárního nástroje změnil na nástroj, kterým uživatelé začali vyjadřovat své emoce, aniž by brali ohled na to, zda takový osobní a emocionální hashtag přispěje ke kategorizaci twitter příspěvku, případně k jeho lepší viditelnosti a dohledání. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co analýza hashtagů na sociální síti Twitter podle mého názoru musí inherentně předpokládat, je fakt, že ať už hashtag zastupuje subjektivní emocionální vztahy, nebo naopak objektivní a cílenou kategorizaci příspěvku za účelem snažšího vyhledávání, zvolený hashtag nutně souvisí s jednak s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vlastním příspěvkem</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, jednak i s otatními tagy v rámci stejného příspěvku.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokud tomu tak je, nepokládám hashtagy zastupující emoce za problém. Naopak, analýza hastagů může odkrýt nejen spolu související témata (např. když jsou témata indikována hashtagy, které jsou užity v rámci jednoho příspěvku), ale také to, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">jaký osobní postoj a emoce</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> uživatelé zastávají k danému tématu (např. když uživatel v jednom příspěvku použije jeden z hashtagů jako zástupce hlavního tématu a jeden a více hashtagů pro vyjádření osobního, emocionálního postoje k danému tématu).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vrátím-li se k původnímu tématu tohoto textu — analýze amerických prezidentských voleb — mám v plánu využít výše zmíněné hypotézy: pokud twitter příspěvek obsahuje více hashtagů, budou tyto hashtagy znázorňovat mimo jiné vztahy mezi hlavními tématy konkrétního </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vlastního příspěvku</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a vztah mezi hlavními tématy a subjektivních, emocionálních reakcí. Při dostatečném počtu příspěvků by měla analýza odkrýt strukturu sítě vztahů typu </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">téma-téma</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">téma-emocionální reakce</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Metoda</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pro svou analýzu jsem si vybral čtyři prezidentské kandidáty, dva kandidující za Demokratickou stranu a dva kandidáty za Republikány. Jsou jimi Hillary Clintonová, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump a Ted Cruz. Pro jednotlivé kandidáty jsem vybral vhodné hashtagy, které jsou významně spojeny s prezidentkými kampaněni kandidátů. Taková analýza není vyčerpávající, pro jednoho kandidáta existuje více populárních hashtagů, pro pilotní výzkum zvolené hashtagy považuji za postačující.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data pro vybrané hashtagy jsem získal použitím webové aplikace </span><a href=\"http://socioviz.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http://socioviz.net/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, pro kterou je možné zdarma získat uživatelský účet. Ten je omezen tím, kolik aplikace uživateli v rámci jednoho dotazu vrátí výsledků. V současné době je pro uživatele s omezeným účtem zdarma povoleno získat na jeden dotaz až 100 twitter příspěvků z velmi limitovaného časového intervalu jednoho dne. Tento nepříjemný limit lze částečně obejít, pokud si uživatel stáhne data zvlášť pro jednotlivé dny. Bohužel i tak není možné změnit limitovaný časový interval, tudíž twitterové příspěvky budou v daném dni z minutového intervalu mezi časy 18:58 a 18:59. Pro svou analýzu jsem zvolil data mezi dny 1. 4. 2016 a 6. 4. 2016 včetně. Dohromady jsem tak pro každý hashtag pracoval se 600 twitterovými příspěvky.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Zvolené hashtagy</b></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hillary Clintonová: #iamwithher</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bernie Sanders: #feelthebern</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Donald Trump: #donaldtrump</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ted Cruz: #tedcruz</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>Nastavení Gephi</b></h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rozložení: ForceAtlas 2</span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Odsunout středy</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Režim Linlog</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zabránit překrytí</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vliv hmotnosti hrany 1.0</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Změna velikosti 2.0</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gravitace 0.2</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rozsah stupně filter: 5 (pro #tedcruz 12)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modularity Class</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>Nastavení Gephi pro „tag cloud“</b></h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rozložení: Fruchterman Reingold</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rozsah stupně filter: 12</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zobrazit hrany: Ne</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Výsledky</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pro každého kandidáta jsem exportoval dva typy grafů: jeden graf v rozložení ForceAtlas 2 a druhý ve Fruchterman Reingold, který se zdá být přehlednější v případě, pokud můžeme zobrazit hashtagy jako „tag cloud“, bez zvýrazněné vzdálenosti od středního uzlu.

Ve své vlivné knize </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cybertext: Perspectives on ergodic literature</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> píše o ergodicitě jako vlastnosti textu, pro jehož čtení je zapotřebí „netriviální úsilí k procházení textu“ (Aarseth 1997, s. 1). Pojem ergodický si autor vypůjčil z fyziky, ale jelikož etymologický rozbor napoví, že </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ergon </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hodos</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> znamenají práci, respektive cestu, není těžké pochopit, proč se tento pojem hodí k náročnému procházení textových cest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Důležité je říct, že Aarseth pokládá kybertexty za takový druh textů, které se čtou ergodicky. Autora zajímá </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mechanika, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">jakou jsou texty konstruovány, a také odlišná role uživatele-čtenáře, jenž </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hraje </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mnohem aktivnější úlohu než v textech ne-ergodických. Narážka na hraní je cílená, protože na ergodické texty se můžeme dívat jako na labyrinty, svět určité hry nabízející hned několik možností (cest) ke svému vyřešení. Aaspeth píše, že uživatel-čtenář se může v ergodických textech ztratit nejen čiště metaforicky, ale ryze prakticky, prostřednictvým „topologických struktur textuální mašinerie“ (Aarseth 1997, s. 4).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zde se také nachází velká množina nedorozumění mezii Aarsethem a literárními kritiky, z nichž mnozí měli potíže pochopit, v čem se ergodické texty vlastně liší od řekněme složitejší či náročnější literatury jako například Joycův Odysseus, Beckettovy prózy s potrhanou syntaxí, nebo Pustina od T. S. Eliota. Všechny zmíněné díla si od čtenáře jednoznačně žádají více mentální úsilí než Pejska s kočičkou, ale pořád se, dle Aarsetha, pohybujeme v rovině pohybu očí od řádky k řádce. Jinak řečeno, autor netvrdí, že zmíněná díla nemohou být sémanticky nahuštěna tak, že je možné díla intepretovat mnoha způsoby (proto ona náročnost), ale </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mechanika čtení</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> je triviální. Což může vést k mnoha paradoxům: pokud vezmeme nějaký text o Pejskovi a kočičce, necháme se inspirovat cut-up technikou Williama Burroughse a originální text rozstříháme na jednotlivá slova, která složíme do pytlíčku a předáme čtenáři s pokřikem: čti!, v tomto okamžiku se ze čtení této pohádky stává ergodický text, jelikož pro čtení pohádky je třeba vynaložit úsilí, v tomto případě poskládat text dohromady z nastříhaných slov.

Jako jazzový hudebník a klasicky vzdělaný vizuální umělec nejdříve čerpal z hard-edge abstraktní malby. V roce 1967 v jeho umělecké praxi ale přišel zvrat poté, co si vyslechl přednášku francouzského skladatele Pierra Barbauda na téma využití algoritmické kompozice. Na začátku šedesátých let byl Mohr také výrazněn ovlivněn filosofií umění a estetikou německého filosofa Maxe Bense. Bense sám byl vysoce interdisciplinárně zaměřeným člověkem, pro svou teorii </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">racionální estetiky</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> čerpal ze zásadních prací své doby jako např. kybernetika Norberta Wienera, Shannonova teorie informace či Birkhoffova snaha kvantifikovat estetickou krásu díla pomocí měření vztahu uspořádanosti a komplexity. Bense je považován za tvůce konceptu </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">informační estetiky. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bensova racionální estetika </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mohra transformovala a od abstraktního expresionismu se uchýlil k počítačovému umění založeném na algoritmické konstrukci geometrických tvarů.</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-705\" src=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bez-názvu-1.jpg\" alt=\"P-197-N/R801, 1977\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bez-názvu-1.jpg 495w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bez-názvu-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bez-názvu-1-298x300.jpg 298w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p><strong>P-197-N/R801, 1977</strong><br />\nPlotter drawing ink on paper</p>\n<p>zdroj: <a href=\"http://www.bitforms.com/mohr/p-026f-inversion-logique\">http://www.bitforms.com/mohr/p-026f-inversion-logique</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/67598990\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Manfred Mohr &#8222;Cubic Limit,&#8220; 1973-74 Digital transfer of 16mm film 4 min</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algoritmizace uměleckého procesu byla pro Mohra ideální prostředek, jak naplnit Bensovy myšlenky racionalizace umění: Mohr podnikl analýzu svého estetického stylu z posledních deseti let a jak vlastními slovy píše, našel překvapivě mnoho pravidelností a vzorců. Z těch vytvořil syntax, tedy pravidla pro kombinaci jednotlivých elementů, jež následně matematiky popsal, což mu umožnilo takto formalizovaný vlastní „umělecký styl“ převést do algoritmu v programovacím jazyce.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">„The first step in that direction was an extended analysis of my own paintings and drawings from the last ten years. It resulted in a surprisingly large amount of regularities, determined of course by my particular aesthetical sense, through which I was able to establish a number of basic elements that amounted to a rudimentary syntax. After representing these basic constructions through a mathematical formalism, and setting them up in an abstract combinatorial framework, I was in a position to realize all possible representations of my algorithms.” (Mohr 1971)</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mohr zmiňuje v jednom z rozhovorů</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, že v 70. letech dvacátého století bylo při zrodu počítačového umění nejsložitější se vůbec k nějakému počítači dostat. Mohr vysvětluje, že jeho první díla vznikala na mainframovém počítači, který byl ve vlastnictví metereologického institutu v Paříži. Mohrovi bylo dovoleno po večerech na počítači pracovat také proto, že tehdejší ministr zodpovědný za povolení měl pro Mohra pochopení, jelikož v mládím byl sám praktikujícím umělcem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mohrův vizuální styl se dále vyznačoval tím, že používal pouze dvě barvy: černou a bílou. Tato volba doplňuje celkovou binárnost jeho tvorby, Mohr ale uvádí, že se pouze pro dvě barvy rozhodnul ještě dříve, než se začal věnovat počítačovému umění kvůli tomu, že chtěl, aby dílo bylo hodnoceno na základě tvaru, nikoli barvy. Jeho pozdější tvorba ale již barev využívá.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V posledních čtyřiceti letech Mohr dále zkoumá estetiku generativního umění. Za jakousi šablonu, ze které jeho díla vycházejí, mu slouží vícedimenzionální krychle, jež, s odkazem na Bense, zobrazuje matematickou pravdu a koncept objektivní krásy (Klutch 2012, s. 79).</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bez-názvu-2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-708 size-full\" src=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bez-názvu-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"588\" height=\"571\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bez-názvu-2.jpg 588w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bez-názvu-2-300x291.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p><strong>P-1611-6_10, 2012</strong><br />\nPigment-ink on canvas</p>\n<p>zdroj: <a href=\"http://www.bitforms.com/mohr/p-1611-6_10\">http://www.bitforms.com/mohr/p-1611-6_10</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zdroje:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KLUTSCH, Christoph a (eds.). 2012.

Jinak řečeno, světy vytvořené filmovými a softwarovými tvůrci nemusí obsahovat nejen fyzikální zákony, ale ani cokoli jiného z našeho světa; jejich světy jsou omezené pouze kreativitou svých tvůrců.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kreativita jako teoretický koncept stále přináší více otázek než odpovědí, čemuž se nemůžeme divit, jelikož mnozí teoretici označují kreativní myšlení za pantheon nejvyššího lidského myšlení, což se mimo jiné také projevuje v interdisciplinárním oboru umělé inteligence, kde dosáhnutí AI obsahující kreativitu se považuje za bod, singularitu, kdy stroj nahradí člověka.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Není třeba znát dopodrobna, jak se kreativita manifestuje v lidské myšlení, aby o ní teoretici prohlásili, co já považuji za common sense tezi, tedy že ať už kreativita funguje jakkoli, člověk nikdy nevytváří věci ex nihilo, ale odkazuje se při tvorbě na již existující myšlenky, objekty a svět. Takto argumentuje například filosof Nelson Goodman, když ve své knize Způsovy světatvorby implicitně zavrhuje, že by člověk dokázal tvořit, aniž by do této tvorby nezahrnul sebe i socio-kulturní kontext, ve kterém tvoří. Goodman píše:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">„Světatvorby, tvoření světů, tak jak je známe, vždy vycházejí ze světů, které jsou již po ruce; tvoření je vlastně přetvářením či znovuvytvářením“ (Goodman, 1996)</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dále se můžeme opřít o prominentní teoretiky designu, kteří Goodmanovi přitakávají. Architekt, teoretik a matematik Christopher Alexander píše v knize </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notes on the Synthesis of Form</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, že: „proces designu je třeba vidět jako proces korekce chyb“. Podle autora „jsme naprosto neschopni formulovat designérský problém jinak, než jako chyby, které jsme objevili v minulých řešeních minulých problémů“ (Alexander, 1971, s. 8).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teoretik Jan Michl souhlasí, když vidí design jako redesign. Michl tvrdí, že každý funkční kompletní výrobek, jako výstup designérské činnosti, není tvořen ex nihilo, ale je nevyhnutelně „výsledkem redesignu, tzn. rezultátem práce mnoha designérů, respektive postupného drobného i radikálního vylepšování předchozích řešení, přičemž žádný z jednotlivých účastníků tohoto procesu není s to předvídat ani plánovat komplexnost řešení pozdějších“ (Michl, 2012, s. 24).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chceme-li dále nashromáždit důkazy podporující tyto teze, nic nám nebrání, abychom pohlédli na současné filosofické teorie kreativity. Jelikož jsem tuto cestu za poznáním kreativity již podstoupil, shrnu zde akorát, že současné teorie kreativity se skutečně přiklání tomu, že na tvorbu </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nových, funkční a užitečných </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">věcí (kreativity) lze pohlížet jako na vyvíjející se, evoluční proces závislý na kontextu, ve kterém ony věci vznikají. Jinak řečeno, kreativita se nezdá být absolutní, ale musí být porovnávána uvnitř daného referečního rámce, což znamená, že to co je kreativní pro Evropana, nemusí nutně být vůbec zajímavé pro obyvatele Jižní Ameriky.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokud aspoň část z těchto teorií má co dočinění s tím, jak tvoříme a hodnotíme kreativní výsledky činnosti, ihned se nám odkrývá logická a potenciálně dost užitečná pedagogická teorie a praxe: co může student jakéhokoli kreativního oboru ihned podniknout, aby se ve svém oboru výrazně zlepšil, je seznámit se s aktuálními kreativními výsledky, u kterých se zamyslí, proč jsou takové jaké jsou, z jakých předchozích řešení se vyvinuly, jaké předcházející problémy řeší, případně jaké nové problémy přináší, a nakonec na jejich základu vytvořil vlastní nové řešení.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co se týče vývoje interakcí mezi člověkem a počítačem, filmy jsou obzvláště zajímavým zdrojem inspirace z mnoha zřejmých důvodů. Tak například budget velkofilmu se pohybuje ve zcela jiných číslech než tradiční projekty tvořící interakční rozhraní, a přestože neupírám možnost nízkorozpočtovým projektům přijít se zajímavými novými výsledky, v dnešní kapitalistické tržní ekonomice se rodí inovativní, rozsáhlé projekty většinou na dvou frontách: tam, kde jsou enormní částky peněz, a tam, kde jsou enormní částky peněz. Ne, není to překlep, mám samozřejmě na mysli zcela odlišné fronty: privátní korporátní sféru a veřejný sektor v podobě univerzitních institucí a jiných výzkumných středisek. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jak velkolepé scifi filmy, tak i studenti v MIT Media Labu budou vždy vycházet z předchozích řešení. Otázkou je, jak ve skutečnosti scifi filmy využívají svého enormního budgetu a mnoha talentovaných lidí k tomu, aby oblast interakčního designu, čímž mám na mysli i akademický obor HCI, posunuli dopředu, zdali vůbec. Neméně zajímavou otázkou je, jak velkovýpravné filmy jako třeba Prometheus Ridleyho Scotta čerpají z existujícího akademického i komečního výzkumu, který implementují do svého díla. Na tyto a další otázky se za pomoci filmu Prometheus zaměřím, a to tak, že na základě vlastního uvážení vyberu zajímavé interface z filmu, který podrobněji analyzuji odpověďmi na připravené otázky.</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-665\" src=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/prometheus-00_57_582016-03-12-17h05m50s731.png\" alt=\"-prometheus-00_57_582016-03-12-17h05m50s731\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/prometheus-00_57_582016-03-12-17h05m50s731.png 1920w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/prometheus-00_57_582016-03-12-17h05m50s731-300x125.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/prometheus-00_57_582016-03-12-17h05m50s731-768x321.png 768w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/prometheus-00_57_582016-03-12-17h05m50s731-1024x428.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Ukázka grafického interakčního rozhraní z filmu Prometheus</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Při porovnání s otatní technologií z filmu si vybírám poměrně nudný objekt. Jedná se o skleněnou či plastovou, každopádně transparentní „smartpad“ destičku, na které je dle filmu možné zobrazit data.</span></p>\n<p><b>Kdyby taková technologie byla používána v běžné domácnosti, jak by vypadala?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hlavní důvod, proč mě tato technologie a její interakční design zaujal, je že tento druh destiček dle mého názoru přijde brzy na komerční trh, kde nahradí chytré telefony a tablety. Bude se jednat o skleněnou destičku, která bude mít v sobě integrované veškeré potřebné obvody pro dotykové ovládání a zobrazení jakéhokoli obsahu. Její nesmírnou výhodou bude, že jeden hardware dokáže zobrazit jakýkoli software, takže uživatelé nejspíše budou mít tuto destičku mnohem déle než dnešní chytré telefony, protože takto generický a neutrální vzhled jen těžko může pro danou funkci něco překonat; inženýři a designéři, kteří budou tyto destičky navrhovat, se nebudou muset zabývat estetickou stránku zařížení, místo toho budou přemýšlet, jaký software, funkcionality a interakce vytvoří. </span></p>\n<p><b>Jaké implikace by znamenalo masové přijetí takové technologie (kde mohou být všude používány, etické ot. apod.)?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To by také znamenalo, že by se redukoval odpad pramenící z toho, že dnešní chytré telefony a tablety jsou pokládány za zastaralé jen kvůli svému vzhledu a nikoli nutně pro svůj hardware. Takto generický vzhled by stimuloval alokaci financí a lidských zdrojů do vývoje nových interakcí a funkcionalit. Na úrovni společnosti by masové přijetí skleněných destiček jako přenosných zobrazovacích zařízení znamenalo šetření přírody, méně odpadu, lepší recyklaci materiálu, a tak ekologičtější a čistší svět, za předpokladu, že výroba této technologie nebude náročná a znečišťující. </span></p>\n<p><b>Jak je inspirováno přítomností a jak může ovlivnit budoucnost HCI?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Konceptuálně jsou podobné skleněné destičky již poměrně zastaralé. Již několik let se před vydáním nového Apple telefonu iPhone objevují na internetu neoficiální konceptuální návrhy, které využívají transparentních materiálů a moderního vizuálně-interakčního jazyka. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do širokého povědomí se také zapsala společnost Microsoft, když vydala své vynikají video představující v rámci produktu Office produktivní život v roce 2019. Skleněné destičky s propracovaným softwarem a interakcemi jsou v tomto videu představeny jako nepostradatelní pomocníci v pracovním životě, vzdělávání, ale i pro každodenní činnost.</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><iframe style=\"width: 853px; height: 480px; max-width: 100%;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Ff7SzP4gfg\" width=\"853\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Koncept video Microsoftu představující profesionální i soukromý život v roce 2019</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Koncept video od Microsoft (i jiných) dobře předznamenávají směr vývoje nejen interakčního designu, ale i celé disciplíny HCI: hardware ustupuje do pozadí, mnohem důležitější jsou softwarové funkcionality, které jsou dostupné napříč spektrem zařížení. Pokud potenciálně každá plocha bude plátnem pro interakci mezi člověkem a počítačem, je nevyhnutelné, že budoucnost oboru HCI bude mnohem více orientována na holistické pojetí interakce. Ta nebude interakcí mezi zařízením a člověkem, ale hlubším srůstáním člověka a komputerizovaného okolního světa. Svět, jak se zdá, bude jedno velké „interakční plátno“. Taková synergie lidského a umělého vyžaduje pojmosloví dnes se vyskytující v sociologii, kulturologii, ale i v systémové vědě a kybernetice. Designovat interakce bude znamenat </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">designovat život sám</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><b>Co by se mohlo stát, kdyby technologie nefungovala nebo fungovala špatně/hacking?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jestliže jsem skleněnou destičku popsal jako symbol masivní interakce s okolním prostředí, nechci tím naznačit, že by film s touto vizí nepočítal. Sám totiž obsahuje scény, kde sklo je skutečně plátnem pro interakce a ovládání složité technologie. Mám-li uvažovat o tom, co by se stalo, kdybychom byli na takto masivní interakci se světem až příliš závislí, hodí se si vzpomenout na úvodní scény filmu Prometheus, kde robot David probouzí posádku z hibernace, kterou zajišťují hibernační pody. Ty jsou ovládané vizuálně-interakčními elementy zobrazenými na skleněném těle. Když dotykové ovládání přestane fungovat u osobních ručních zařízení, nic se neděje, pro zařízení využívaných v odvětvích jako zdravotnictví, vyžadujících stoprocentní funkčnost budou následky fatální.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\f</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-672\" src=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-12-3.png\" alt=\"2016-03-12 (3)\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-12-3.png 1920w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-12-3-300x169.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-12-3-768x432.png 768w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-12-3-1024x576.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Když dotykové ovládání přestane fungovat u osobních ručních zařízení, nic se neděje, pro zařízení využívaných v odvětvích jako zdravotnictví, vyžadujících stoprocentní funkčnost budou následky fatální.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Literatura:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ALEXANDER, Christopher. 1971. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notes on the synthesis of form</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Budem schopni říci, že jeden popis je lepší než druhý? Na základě čeho jednotlivým popisům přisoudíme Hodnotu?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jednou z možností, jak podstoupit tuto aktivitu, je deklarovat, že nejlepší představa pasáže z Bible je taková, která je nejvíce věrná své předloze. Ihned ale narazíme na problém, jestliže popis vyžaduje představit si něco, pro co sám neposkytuje informace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V pasáži Marek 14,17—25 se dočteme o tom, že Ježíš seděl a stoloval s dvanácti dalšími lidmi, ze kterých ho jeden zradí („Amen, pravím vám: Jeden z vás mě zradí, ten který se mnou jí.&#8220;). Dále z textu jednoduše usoudíme, že společné stravování, o kterém nemůžeme říci, zda se jedná o obědu či večeři, protože ze samotného textu se to nedočteme, se skládalo z pojídání chleba i pití vína, což byly pro přítomné osoby nejspíše symbolické akty. Nakonec se dočteme o tom, že postava jménem Ježíš se považuje za Syna člověka, který bude v blíže neurčené budoucnosti opět pít z plodu révy v Božím králoství. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Záměrně vyjmenovávám text pasáže takto kostrbatě a doslova, jelikož chci zdůraznit, že obsahuje velice málo kotevních bodů, ze kterých by si šlo představit ucelenou scénu v hlavě. Nic nám sice nebrání, aby naše mentální představa byla neúplná, útržkovitá, ale je nepravděpodobné, že bychom si představili Ježíše bez toho, aniž by byl zcela bez jakýchkoli vlastností. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zcela věrná vizuální představa na základě textu je tak možná pouze tehdy, když popis obsahuje bezezbytkově veškeré informace. V extrémním případě by to znamenalo, že bychom po textu museli vyžadovat, aby scénu popsal na úrovni fyzikálních zákonů. Taková úroveň přesnosti by ale byla nepraktická (nikdo by toho nejspíše nebyl schopen přenést přesnost popisu na mentální obraz) a zároveň by tak či onak byla neúplná, protože současné fyzikální zákony nedokáží popsat celou fyzikální realitu (viz nekompatibilita kvantové fyziky a teorie relativity) a mnoho dalších jevů sice existujících v naší fyzikální realitě, ale těžko redukovatelných na nějaké fyzikální zákony. Skepsi vůči tomuto </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fyzikalismu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> vyjádřil i např. Nelson Goodman, který o redukování všeho na fyziku řekl, že takový požadavek je </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">„[&#8230;] mlhavý, neboť samotná fyzika je fragmentární, nestabilní a druh i konsekvence předpokládané redukce jsou vágní. (Jak byste redukovali Constablův světonázor či pohled na svět Jamese Joyce na fyziku?)“ (Goodman, 1996)</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hodláme-li si vůbec představovat danou scénu, musíme se zdát nároku na kompletní věrnost naší mentální vize, jelikož, jak jsme již zmínili, naše kognitivní vybavení neobsahuje prostředky, kterými bychom si člověka, chléb či jakýkoli </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rozprostraněný </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">objekt vyobrazili v mysli bez výšky, šířky, barvy a jiných atributů. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dobrali jsme se tedy poznání, že vyobrazená scéna z Bible každého z participujících na tomto úkolu bude nutně obsahovat něco, co z textu není patrné. Námi doplněné chybějící částečky puzzle ale nejsou zvolené zcela náhodně, potřebná vizuální vodítka si nevyhnutelně mozek doplní z vlastních zdrojů počínaje znalostmi, zážitky a konče strukturou biologického make-upu. Byli jsme požádáni, abychom vytvořili </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">svět</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, jeho obsah bude vycházet z našeho subjektivního, biologicko-kulturního referenčního rámce. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Říká se, že snad pouze Bůh dokáže tvořit </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ex-nihilo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Vnímání i vytváření obrazů nás smrtelných lidí ale nikdy neprobíhá na zcela čistém pozadí, vždy jsme svázáni a ovlivněni tím, že patříme k určitému biologickému druhu, který žije v socio-kulturním kontextu a poznává tento kontextu na základě pravidel odvozených z fungování relevantních orgánů.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Po goodmanovsku bychom řekli, že </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">„Světatvorby, tvoření světů, tak jak je známe, vždy vycházejí ze světů, které jsou již po ruce; tvoření je vlastně přetvářením či znovuvytvářením“ (Goodman, 1996)</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Otázka položená na začátku se tak jeví jako nevhodná: protože neexistuje žádný absolutní a neutrální rámec, podle kterého bychom vize objektivně porovnali, naskytá se možnost vize pojmout jako autonomní estetické vizuální objekty. U těch sice není možné vyžadovat objektivní pravdivostní hodnotu, ale zbývá nám neméně zajímavá práce prozkoumat, jakou vlastní inherentní logiku tyto vize-malby mají a z jakých referenčních rámců tuto logiku čerpají. Potom soudci našich obrazů nebudou vědeckými badateli, ale spíše uměleckými kritiky A ti dle Artura Danta pomocí vhodné interpretace mohou některé vize povznést na umělecká díla.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">***</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Má vize biblické pasáže Poslední večeře se odehrává v kamenném domě s dřevěnou střechou. Scénu večeře jsem viděl zcela odlišně od konvenčních zobrazeních, které si v tuto chvíli vybavím. Pro asymetrický stůl, ani vnitřek domu nenacházím žádnou jasnou referenci. U stolu ani v místnosti dokonce nenacházíme všech dvanáct apoštolů. Je možné, že jsem vstoupil do scény zrovna ve chvíli, kdy jen ti Ježíši nejbližší byli přítomni? Kde se ale projevuje jednoznačně konvence je Ježíšovo umístění do význačné pozice u stolu. Nejen, že jsem zde mohl být ovlivněn kulturními zobrazeními, ale také obecně pravidlem, že významná postava usedá na nejvýznamnější místo u stolu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zajímavostí je, že v prvních okamžicích jsem tušil, že nejsem jen nějakým pozorovatel poletujícím nad danou scénou, ale přímo jedním z apoštolů; cítil jsem se být mimo hlavní dění, což bylo naznačeno tím, že jsem seděl na kraji stolu, nejdále od Ježíše. Jako jediný jsem si také všiml, že do místnosti vstoupila stará žena. Nad symbolikou této postavy je dobré se pozastavit. Mohla znamenat něco z mého života? Jistě, nejdříve mě napadlo, že by žena mohla být symbolem mých rodinných poměrů. Dále mohla symbolizovat celý izraelský lid, předávající své dlouhodobé břímě nadcházejícímu spasiteli. Proč si té ženy ale nikdo z přítomných nevšímal?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Postava, kterou jsem ztělesňoval, několikrát vyjádřila pocit studu; nejdříve při pomyšlení na výdělek obchodníka, poté při násilnému chování vůči přítomnému neurčitému zvířeti, a nakonec ve chvíli, kdy se všechny tváře v místnosti otočily jejím směrem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Žena, ani stud dle mého neodkazují na žádné kulturní motivy, nýbrž jsou zhmotněním mého emočního rozpoložení v době meditace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ačkoli v zadání bylo řečeno, že zrak mám zapojit až jako poslední ze smyslů, nepodařilo se mi toho docílit, jelikož ihned po začátku meditace jsem ve svém vědomí držel hrubý nárys celého domu. Potlačit vizuální obrazy bylo jednoznačně nejtěžší částí zadání.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Literatura:</p>\n<p>GOODMAN, Nelson. 1996. <em>Způsoby světatvorby</em>. Bratislava: Archa.

Pro jeho dílo jsou význačné především dvě fráze: „svět umění“ a „konec umění“. Zde se budu věnovat poznámkám k jeho eseji Svět umění (v původní anglické verzi jako Artworld), která vyšla v roce 1961.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Autor na začátku eseje komentuje </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mimésis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, tedy první rigorózní pokus o teorii umění, jejíž kořeny datujeme zpětně až do antického Řecka k Platónovi a Aristotelovi. Mimetická teorie umění hodnotí umělecké dílo na základě toho, jak věrně reprezentuje či zobrazuje realitu.  Z tohoto hlediska není složité pochopit, proč Platón byl vehementním odpůrcem určitých žánrů umění: Platónova říše Forem nebo Idejí obsahovala neměnné a dokonalé recepty pro fyzické i abstraktní objekty, jejichž charakteristickou vlastností bylo, že představovaly pravdu. Ta byla nejušlechtilejším cílem filosofie. Umělec ale pro Platóna nebyl někým, kdo by se zajímal o pravdu, jelikož druhy umění jako poezie, malba nebo divadlo, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pouze </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">napodobovaly nikoli dokonalé Ideje, ale pomíjivé, dočasné a degradující objekty reálné světa. Ba co více jejich díla byla často dvojnásobnou imitací, protože zobrazovala objekty již jednou vytvořené člověkem-řemeslníkem a na co člověk sáhne, to má zákonitě k dokonalosti daleko! Tedy aspoň v očích Platóna.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pro mnoho dalších teoretiků ale mimetická teorie umění představovala velice lákavý způsob hodnocení uměleckých děl. Poskytuje totiž jednoduchou možnost, jak rozlišovat dobrá a špatná umělecká díla: čím více se dílo blíží své reálné předloze, tím více naplňuje funkci umění a tím více se jedná o hodnotnější dílo. Tato teorie byla populární v období renesance a udržela si dominantní postavení až do nedávné doby. Její nedostatky, jak píše Danto, vyšly brzy najevo po vynalezení fotografie. Z mimetické teorie umění by totiž vyplývalo, že jakákoli fotografie by byla inherentně hodnotnější než díla z jiného uměleckého žánru, ať už by se jednalo o rodinné fotografie z dovolené nebo selfie s našpulenou pusou. Mimetická teorie finálně zapadla s příchodem abstrakního umění, kde imitaci reálného světa vůbec nenalezáme. O nic lépe by si mimetická teorie neporadila se známým Duchampovým pisoárem a krabicemi Brillo Andyho Warhola. Tyto dvě díla z dvacátého století slouží Dantovi jako příklady toho, jak i současnější teorie kladoucí důraz na estetické kvality nebo formální prvky, mohou mít problémy identifikovat dadaistický pisoár a pop-artovou krabici jako umělecká díla. Danto se tak ptá, co z těchto a ostatních objektů dělá umělecká díla, zvláště když:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[&#8230;] v dnešní době si člověk vůbec nemusí všimnout, že se pohybuje na půdě umění bez </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">toho, že by mu to teorie sdělila.</span></p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-633\" src=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/l2_v340989_958_992_688-8.jpg\" alt=\"l2_v340989_958_992_688-8\" width=\"992\" height=\"688\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/l2_v340989_958_992_688-8.jpg 992w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/l2_v340989_958_992_688-8-300x208.jpg 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/l2_v340989_958_992_688-8-768x533.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Lepenkové Brillo krabice Andyho Warhola. Je to umění? A proč?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dantovou radikální tezí je, že „uměleckost“ uměleckých děl nemáme hledat v objektech samotných, ale mimo ně, v prostředí, ve kterém existují, ve <em>světě umění</em> a uměleckých teorií, neboť to jsou právě ony, které umožňují umělecká díla. Jinak řečeno, umělecká díla vznikají tehdy, když existuje teorie, která je dokáže interpretovat, teorie </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">umožňuje </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">umění:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">„Vidět něco jako umění vyžaduje cosi, co oko nemůže odhalit – atmosféru umělecké teorie, znalost dějin umění: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">svět umění.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Přestože umělecká díla jsou určitými objekty, podle Danta nemůžeme říci, že umělecká díla jsou </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pouze </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">těmito objekty. To se nám snaží naznačit i ve výše citované větě: umělecké dílo se skládá z nějaké hmatatelné, materiální části, ale také je tvořeno svou nemateriální částí, která je právě definována prostřednictvím vztahů ke světu umění skládajícího se z teorií, děl, teoretiků, kurátorů, muzeí, atd. Všechny potenciální umělecká díla si tak můžeme představit tak, že existují v abstraktní síti, kde díla jsou propojena s teoriemi, které zároveň jsou dále propojeny s předchozími, již existujícími uměleckými díly. Kandidátní umělecká díla vyčkávají, až se tato </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">struktura</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> zformuje do vhodné podoby, která vrhne, prostřednictvím umělecké teorie, na ně světlo, a tím je pasuje na umělecká díla.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokud se vrátíme k pisoáru Duchampa nebo Warholovým skulpturám z lepenkových krabic Brillo, můžeme zodpovědět otázku, co z těchto obyčejných objektů dělá umění. Po fyzické stránce mohou skutečně být od svých negalerijních kopií k nerozeznání, přesto nejsou identické. Kde se liší je právě ona nemateriální část, která obsahuje výsledek interakce daného objektu s celým uměleckým světem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aby teorie dokázala intepretovat nová díla, potřebuje, aby byla průběžně obnovována a rozšiřována. Tento požadavek je zajištěn pokaždé, když umělecký svět přijme pod svá křídla dílo, jež obsahuje nové, dosavadními umělci doposud neužité vlastnosti. Danto o těchto „vlastnostech“ hovoří poněkud techničtěji, když užívá termínu </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">predikátu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, se kterým se hojně setkáme v lingvistice nebo logice. Predikát v lingvistice je obecně přísudkem věty. Danto má na mysli konkrétní predikát realizovaný jmenným přísudkem se sponou. Jsou to věty, kde podstatné jméno následují specifická slovesa jako </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">být </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">či </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stát se</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, doplněné o přídavné jméno. Tak například věta </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">umělecké dílo U je expresivní</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. „Je expresivní“ je jmenný přísudek, který přisuzuje podstatnému jménu „umělecké dílo U“ vlastnost „expresivní“. Co tedy přináší nová umělecká díla jsou právě nové predikáty, jež může teorie využít pro popis a interpretaci. Nové predikáty jsou přídavkem k existujícícm interpretačním nástrojům. Vztah umělecké dílo—teorie není jednosměrný, ale lze jej popsat jako obousměrnou, vzájemnou interakci.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strukturalistická lingvistika tvrdí, že význam slov je dán tím, že v jazyce existují jiná slova, která se od prvního slova liší, a tato diference dává vzniknout významu individuálních slov. Jinak řečeno, na jazyk lze pohlížet jako na systém, strukturu (odtud strukturalismus), kde jednotlivé elementy spolu interagují, jelikož každý element přispívá, neboli participuje na významu elementů ostatních.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ačkoli nejsem zběhlý ve strukturalistické kritice umění, myslím, že nebudu zcela mimo, když prohlásím, že Dantova teorie v podstatě hlásí totéž: umění je struktura složená z mnoha elementů, mezi které řadíme samotná díla, teorie, instituce, aj., a jejich interakce (s mnoha feedback loopy) i evoluce (v případě, kdy se do struktury přidají nová díla, nové intepretační predikáty) tvoří ekosystém nazvaný Svět umění, ve kterém elementy participují na významu ostatních elementů za pomoci synonymie, antonymie, metonymie a jiných vztahů známých z lingvistiky. Příkladem jsou v malířství abstraktní puristé, jejichž „plátna mohou existovat coby umění jen proto, že existují ‚nepuristické‘ malby.“</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Z toho všeho mi logicky vyplývá toto: umělci a celé umění jednoznačně těží z výborných teoretiků. Jelikož umění patří mezi nejvyšší a nejkomplexnější lidské aktivity, měli bychom se postarat o to, abychom měli do budoucna dostatek vysoce vzdělaných, erudovaných, inteligentních a kreativních teoretiků. V opačném případě se může stát, pokud se to již neděje, že umění přijme pod svá křídla cokoli, „anything goes“ bude standardem, podle kterého se budou (ne)hodnotit nová, kandidátní umělecká díla. Arthur Danto si toho byl vědom.

Tato forma meditačního cvičení nabádá, abychom na cestě ve zbližování se s Ježíšem odložili intelekt a místo toho poznali Ježíše a jeho skutky skrze naše smysly a představivost. Sv. Ignác křesťanům poskytnul techniku, která jim umožňuje mnohem intimnější kontakt s Písmem a životem nejen Ježíše, ale také ostatních postav. Myslet, ale hlavně prožít!</p>\n<p>To je vše v pořádku, ale co to má společného se současnou vizuální kulturou, tedy předmětem, pro který jsme toto cvičení dostali předepsáno? Přestože se nám Josef Šlerka upřímně vyznal ze svého přesvědčení, náboženská tématika je v tomto cvičení druhotná, spíše bylo nutné vybrat příběh či obrazový materiál, který bude do jisté míry dobře znám všem přítomným (testovacím semio-krysám). Hlavním cílem toho, proč jsme si měli najít čas na meditace, ve které vypneme neustále ve hlavě štěbetající intelekt a ponoříme se do prostoru pouze svými smysly (v pořadí sluch, hmat, čich, chuť a nakonec i zraku), je zkoumání, zdali se mezi účastníky tohoto experimentu najdou podobné obrazy, chutě či zvuky a pokud ano, proč tomu tak je?</p>\n<p>Nalezení podobností ve vizualizaci scény z Marka 14: 17—25 jistě nebude překvapivé, vždyť všichni jsme byli vychováváni v podobné, ne-li stejné kultuře; mnozí z nás také viděli da Vinciho Poslední večeři. Co když ale nalezneme shody tam, kde kultura a viděné známé obrazy nemohou být dostatečným vysvětlením? Nebudou tyto nalezená symbolická smyslová data výsledkem dotknutí se globálního a sdíleného pole zakořeněných symbolů a archetypů, tedy dle Carla G. Junga<em> kolektivního nevědomí</em> ? Tak či onak, přidávám výsledek své meditace, která není předpřipraveným popisem uvedené kapitoly Bible, ale zachycení záblesků jednotlivých smyslových dat, které jsem se pokusil sestavit do ucelené narativní formy.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jak nepatřičné to musí být, že právě v tento důležitý okamžik sedím s naším Pánem a ostatními z dvanácti se zavřenýma očima a snažím se vštípit si do paměti vše, co proudí mými smysly. Jistě mě právě teď nevěřícně ostatní pozorují a přemýšlí nad tím, co se skrývá za mým chováním. Anebo že bych se v jejich zájmu o mou osobu zmýlil? Je to možné, neboť slyším pouze veselou konverzaci. Bujarý a plný smích přichází odněkud přede mnou. Hlasů ale slyším více. Další sedí po mé pravici, kdežto nalevo ode mě neslyším nikoho hovořit. Místnost, ve které dnes hodujeme, musí být opatřena okny, jelikož k nám z ulice přichází zvuk klopýtání a naříkání ovcí, včetně tlumeného zvuku pastevního zvonce, kterými je nejspíše ozdoben jejich huňatý a měkký krk.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stále oslepen temnotou nahmatávám pevné dřevěné tělo stolu i lavice, která se otřásá, kdykoli vypukne smích, nebo se jen někdo prudce nahne. Sandálem na levé noze zkoumám chladnou podlahu z kamene. Narážím na kusy sena, jež se mi zapichují do kůže, a mám pocit, že se tu pod stolem prohání něco malého a živého. O co se jedná se dozvím, až otevřu oči. To ale ještě nemám v plánu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cítím a chutnám hutnou zeleninovou polévku a krajíc čestvého chlebu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tanec příborů pokračuje a čím déle mám zavřené oči, tím podrobněji jsem schopný si všímat rušné a živé zvukové kulisy linoucí se z ulice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Otevírám oči a konečně vidím skutečné obrysy objektů, které se předchozí smysly doposud snažily nepřesně a fragmentárně popsat. Jak jsem tušil, příliš obsesivně se snažím vztahovat veškeré dění světa na svou osobu; nikdo si mě nevšímá, na protější straně stolu v žoviální náladě spolu debatují čtyři ze dvanáctky, jejich tmavé kudrnaté vlasy, opálené a zarostlé tváře doplňují jejich jinak mírné obličeje. Sedíme u stolu, který mi připomíná tvar písmene „J“, které je ale zrcadlově převrácené po své vertikální ose a navíc místo zaoblené linky je nutné si představit ostré pravé rohy. Sedím s dalšími pěti na delší straně písmene J, naproti na výběžku sedí tři další, náš Pán samozřejmě uprostřed v části spojující obě strany stolu. Není nás dvanáct, kde jsou ostatní?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Odtrhávám na chvíli oči z našeho stolu a vidím, že sedíme v prostorné místnosti, jejíž podlaha a zdi jsou z opracovaných kusů kamene a střecha ze dřeva. Místnost není hermeticky uzavřená, naopak k nám proudí čerstvý a studený vzduch dvěma obdélníkovými otvory. Musím pro nedostatek vhodných slov nazvat okny. Zprostředkovávají mi pohled na rušný život venku na cestě. Po pravé straně, přes ramena našeho Pána vidím konečně pastýře či obchodníka, který si u těla drží svou ovci. V hlavě přemítám, kolik si asi dnes při svých obchodních záležitostech vydělal, a zároveň rychle pociťuji nevhodnost této otázky. Jelikož sedím čelem k východu tohoto domu a nejsem zaujat konverzací s druhými, jako první a jediný tak spatřuji velmi starou ženu, s obličejem plným vrásek z tichého, chudého života, jež na svých zádech pomalu nese těžký stoh slámy. Zastaví se v rohu místnosti, opatrně slaměněný stoh pokladá na podlahu. Stejně pomalým tempem, kterým přišla, opouští dům. Nepozdravena a rázem zapomenuta.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Říkal jsem, že cítím nějaké krůčky a pohyby na podlaze. Nemýlil jsem se. Ohnu se, abych se podíval pod stůl, kde vidím shrbené kuře nebo malou kachnu, nejsem si přesně jistý, protože srovnávání druhů nikdy nepatřilo mezi mé přednosti. To malé, neposedné zvíře mě ale irituje, nemám rád, když se mi něco prohání pod nohama, natož zvíře, o kterém nic nevím. Znovu nahlížím pod stůl a snažím se toho škůdce sandálem odkopnout. V poslední chvíli se ale zarážím, uvědomuji si, že tento čin by mě mohl uvrhnout do podezření, že nejsem mírumilovný člověk. Náš Pán by s tím určitě nesouhlasil. Co vůbec dělá?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Celou dobu nepromluvil a většinu času trávil zadumán nad svou polévkou. Snažil se v ní něco nalézt?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vstává ze židle a začíná se procházet po místnosti. Dojde ke stohu sena, který přinasla ona neznámá stará žena, a vrátí se zpět ke stolu. Usedá. Aniž by zvedl oči, oznamuje nám, že někdo z přítomných ho zradí. Místnost utichá. Všichni, i sám Pán, se na mě dívají. Nemrkají. Pán se opět postaví a všichni ode mě odvrací obličeje.</span></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Úkolem pro předmět Současná vizuální kultura vedený Josefem Šlerkou bylo si představit danou scénu z bible a zapsat popořadě, co náš sluch, hmat, čich, chuť a zrak zaznamenaly.</p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[9,11],"tags":[154,153,24],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/584"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=584"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/584/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":628,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/584/revisions/628"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=584"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=584"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=584"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":582,"date":"2016-02-29T19:59:02","date_gmt":"2016-02-29T18:59:02","guid":{"rendered":"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/?p=582"},"modified":"2016-02-29T19:59:45","modified_gmt":"2016-02-29T18:59:45","slug":"vyzkum-user-experience-designu-v-cr-porovnani-teorie-a-praxe-pilot","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/2016/02/vyzkum-user-experience-designu-v-cr-porovnani-teorie-a-praxe-pilot/","title":{"rendered":"Výzkum User Experience Designu v ČR — Porovnání teorie a praxe (Pilot)"},"content":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[146,12,11,8,23],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/582"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=582"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/582/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":583,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/582/revisions/583"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=582"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=582"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=582"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":567,"date":"2016-01-29T13:57:02","date_gmt":"2016-01-29T12:57:02","guid":{"rendered":"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/?p=567"},"modified":"2016-02-24T22:44:04","modified_gmt":"2016-02-24T21:44:04","slug":"muze-za-nehodu-ve-studence-a-smrt-lidi-spatny-design","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/2016/01/muze-za-nehodu-ve-studence-a-smrt-lidi-spatny-design/","title":{"rendered":"Může za nehodu ve Studénce a smrt lidí špatný design?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Následující text přebírám z diskuze na facebookové stránce ČT24, kde lidé jednoznačně odsoudili výmluvu řidiče, který u soudu argumentoval, že sice světla svítila, ale závory byly nahoře. Jako student teorie designu, který několikrát pročítal <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> od Dona Normana, jsem se v diskuzi pokusil o něco absurdního: bránit řidiče. Níže je můj celý komentář z diskuze:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Řidič patří do vězení, přesto bychom se mohli zamyslet nad jeho argumentem, tedy že závory a světla nebyly „synchronizovány“. Dle mého zde hlavním viníkem je chybný DESIGN celého systému železničních přejezdů. Z velmi povrchní analýzy toho, co závory a světla komunikují, je patrné, že symbolizují zákaz. Zatímco světlo má pouze vizuálně komunikační funkci, závora je prostředek, který má taktéž funkci mechanickou, tedy buď poskytuje možnost projet, nebo naopak znemožňuje projetí. Prozatím vše na úrovni selského rozumu. Jenže z psychologie a teorie designu víme, že závora poskytuje tzv. &#8222;affordance&#8220;, tedy svým vzhledem a tvarem komunikuje, co závora znamená a co s ní člověk (řidič) může dělat. Odhlédneme od všech zákonů, musíme usoudit, že &#8222;affordance&#8220; závory, když je nahoře, je možnost projet; když je dole, &#8222;affordance&#8220; je nemožnost projet. Z psychologie i teorie designu víme, že pokud světlo hlásá &#8222;nejezdi&#8220;, ale &#8222;affordance&#8220; závory umožňuje &#8222;projet&#8220;, vzniká zmatek, kognitivní disonance. Je jisté, že pokud je člověk doma u PC, cucá coca-colu, jeho myšlení funguje jinak, než když má za sebou celý den ježdění a soustředění. Chci tím říci, že na jednu stranu můžeme mít zákony, které něco přikazují, ale zákon je myšlenka pouze na papíře. Železniční přejezd nemůže spoléhat na to, že za každé okolnosti bude člověk tyto myšlenky respektovat. Sice ex-post může ten, kdo je poruší, do vězení, ale lidské životy to nezachrání. Takže jsem toho názoru, že důležitá je prevence, železniční přejezd by měl poskytovat správné &#8222;affordances&#8220;, a to ihned, když je to nutné. Ihned po tom, co začne svítit světlo, by nemělo být možné vjet na přejezd. Ihned. Zákon je jedna věc, ale chybný design a inženýrství druhý. Nepotřebujeme lepší zákony, ale chytřejší designéry a inženýry, jejichž návrhy budou předcházet problémům. DESIGN železničních přejezdů je špatný, DESIGN železničních přechodů připravuje lidi o život. Don Norman, teoretik designu, říká, neviňte uživatele (řidiče) za jeho chybné chování, viníkem je VŽDY designér. Ten, kdo navrhl systém železničních přejezdů, se podílí na smrti těchto lidí.

The times that seem to be, consciously or unconsciously, heavily influenced by what has already turned out to be prophetic books. As all holy books, these literary fortune-tellers consist of fictional narratives of an abhorrent nature, which unfortunately are already realities. Or what could be more Orwellian that the latest story forged together not in the dirt of underworld, but at the most pristine places of our society: the intellectual monasteries of academia? Now, in the technologically most advanced times, it is actually possible to publish a scientific article claiming that diet soft drinks are better for losing weight than clean water. The article underwent a peer-review process, that is true, but let’s not pay attention to the fact that “the research was funded by the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) Europe, whose members include drinks giants such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo“  <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"https://www.rt.com/news/329290-coca-cola-diet-study/\" id=\"return-note-540-1\" href=\"#note-540-1\"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started with a dystopian story of our dystopian times in order to point out the universal truth we can find in the works of masters of dystopian prose such as Orwell, Huxley or Zamyatin, that high-tech culture does not guarantee best outcomes simply because, in the words of historian Melvin Kranzberg: “Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral” <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Melvin Kranzberg, ‘Technology and History: ‘‘Kranzberg’s Laws”’, Technology and Culture 27:3 (1986), p. 54 as cited in Srnicek and Williams, Inventing the future, p.152\" id=\"return-note-540-2\" href=\"#note-540-2\"><sup>2</sup></a>.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Any given technology is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">political </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">but flexible, as it always exists in excess of the purposes for which it may have been designed. <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Ibid, p.152\" id=\"return-note-540-3\" href=\"#note-540-3\"><sup>3</sup></a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We can therefore dismiss with confidence that strange notion portraying technology as an organism somehow existing outside time and space, in a metaphysical realm where everything is neatly determined in the Newtonian fashion. In other words, the notion of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">technological determinism</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been rendered invalid not only by our common sense, but also by academic arguments of people like the great sociologist Manuel Castells who writes that: </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">„We know that technology does not determine society: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[technology]</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">society.

Historically, those needs and values were of course dictated by the ruling classes of the time and even though this has radically changed in the 20th century due to the democratization and “humanization” occurring in the field of design and its methodologies — of which I am going to talk later — it remains truism that the political attributes of large-scale and extremely expensive technological projects are shaped largely by those in power, whoever that might be.</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><a href=\"http://versobooks-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/000005/711/Inventing_the_Future-b828e30703ba1adb8e5d348786269f05.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"width: 215px;\" src=\"http://versobooks-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/000005/711/Inventing_the_Future-b828e30703ba1adb8e5d348786269f05.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"215\" height=\"329\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Inventing the future by Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And it is the latent power of technology to transform the world for the better on which Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams build the whole premise of their latest book </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inventing the Future</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. On technology they write:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The internet and social media are giving a voice to billions who previously went unheard, bringing global participative democracy close than ever to existence. Open-source designs, copyleft creativity, and 3D printing all [promise] a world where the scarcity of many products might be overcome. New forms of computer simulation could rejuvenate economic planning and give us the ability to direct economics rationally in unprecedented ways. The newest wave of automation is creating the possibility for [numerous] types of boring and [humiliating] work to be permanently eliminated. Clean energy technologies make possible virtually limitless and environmentally sustainable forms of power production. And new medical technologies not only enable a longer, healthier life, but also make possible new experiments with gender and sexual identity.&#8220;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the technological advancements listed above are uncontroversial since they are already in place, others waiting to be tapped and developed further. But why should we be afraid to exercise our creativity and base our political strategies on what at the moment still seems to be beyond the reach? Is it not the case that the human brain oftentimes comes up with visions of technologies whose actual construction will inevitable take place some time in near future? Did we forget to re-read the old dusty book called History where we may find that it was in 1908 when:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nikola Tesla foresaw a technology that would allow ‘a business man in New York to dictate instructions, and have them instantly appear in type at his office in London or elsewhere’ and would allow global access to ‘any picture, character, drawing, or print.’” <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"KLEINROCK, Leonard.

Yet it is exactly this utopian thinking that Srnicek and Williams want us to embrace and foster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I started my essay giving an example on how corporatism infiltrates even the most sacred institutions, the authors vehemently proclaim: enough of dystopian and defeatist thinking! But there is a lingering question mark in the air, asking how we got into this negative mindset in the first place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the authors, we can primarily blame the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">capitalist realism</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which Mark Fisher describes as:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“the widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it. Once, dystopian films and novels were exercises in such acts of imagination – the disasters they depicted acting as narrative pretext for the emergence of different ways of living.” <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"FISHER, Marc. Capitalist Realism Is there no alternative?, 2009, p. 1\" id=\"return-note-540-7\" href=\"#note-540-7\"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, even the science fiction authors par excellence find nowadays difficult to ponder an alternative to the current hegemony of neoliberalism and capitalism, which only deepens the marasmus in the collective imagination</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But contemporary Left did react, challenging the status quo by employing various political tactics and conjuring up political movements with mass popular support, yet achieving dubious results. In the core of such thinking is, however, a faulty reasoning stemming from the logic that if technological progress leads to capitalism, then in order to negate capitalism, Left has to negate modernisation as well. In reality, what this thinking of the Left entails is a rejection of all forms of domination, a strong adherence to direct democracy and a decision-making process based on consensus. Srnicek and Williams call this stance </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">folk politics</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The name is derived from customary meanings of the word “folk”: folk as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">local </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">small-scale</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Folk politics embraces the notion that immediacy — that is no political mediation through third parties — politics of horizontalism, local communities, intuition, face to face communication and ethical consumption are more authentic, better and thus preferable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And here is the root of the problem inherent in folk politics: its approach to solving the current economical, social and ecological problems is to scale-down the whole world to the “human level” of local politics so as to be easily manageable. It ignores many crucial points, however. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, far from being only an asset of the Left, many features of folk politics, especially the focus on the local, fair-trade are already parts of the mainstream, happily integrated in the daily routine of capitalist exchange. This fact was famously expressed by Jodi Dean when she said that &#8222;Goldman Sachs doesn&#8217;t care if you raise chickens&#8220; <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"as cited by SRNICEK, Nick and Alex WILLIAMS. Inventing the future: postcapitalism and a world without work. 2015, p. 25\" id=\"return-note-540-8\" href=\"#note-540-8\"><sup>8</sup></a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which can be translated as saying that small, albeit well-meaning alternations at the edge have no potential to alter substantially the whole system. For that, broad, systemic thinking, taking into account the whole ecology of a problem, is necessary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that is the second argument the authors make why contemporary praxis of Left politics is incapable of transcending capitalism into post-capitalist society. Although local politics is necessary, as they claim, since all politics starts at the local level, the book proposes that to make meaningful changes, the Left has to end its antagonism towards any hierarchical structures, abstract analysis or mathematical modelling without which any attempt to comprehend and manage </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">complex problems</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is bound to fail or omit important details which are deeply intertwined with other issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the complex problems the authors portray in the book is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capitalism</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> itself. Who is able to say that understands it? Is it not the reason behind arguments against any social planning that economy (and the society) is so complex that we have to let the individuals and free markets “run the show”?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nick Srnicek writes in his essay in the book Object that a problem with capitalism is that it is beyond our phenomenological experience, that it evades any perceptual or empirical representation, therefore it is essentially </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a non-object</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. How are we to deal with it? And how do we </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feel </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">about it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here I have to borrow from Gilles Deleuze in Mark Fisher’s book </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capitalist Realism</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where he calls Franz Kafka a prophet of distributed, decentralized, cybernetic power. <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"FISHER, Marc.

We endorse the latter position. Any postcapitalist project will necessarily require the creation of new cognitive maps [&#8230; and] technological interfaces [&#8230;]”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to understand the complex non-object such as economy, we need a cognitive prosthesis that would enable us to see better the individual components and more importantly interrelations of the system. Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams argue for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">re-purposing technology, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">emphasizing long-term, mission-oriented thinking rather than the current neoliberal common sense where technology is predominantly created with short-term profits as the sole purpose.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the widespread belief, it is the public which through the State funded the most innovative and crucial technology of last century, be it microchips, development of graphical interface, the Internet, World Wide Web. Quite rightly, the authors call for democratic control over government spending, steering technologies towards socially useful and sustainable goods. Having learnt that technology is intrinsically embedded in society, such re-purposing of the technology means that we need to know exactly how any potential technology will fit into the existing socio-cultural context. Therefore cognitive mapping is required not only for understanding the economy, but also the entire society. What are the actual working methods and processes that can be utilised, without starting from scratch? It turns out there is a field that has been gaining momentum in recent years, and which is perfectly equipped to fulfil these demands: it is design, or more specifically the growing field of fusing formal rigour of cybernetics with human intuition: the field of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">systemic design</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><b>***</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For all those who have not heard the news, we have entered into a new age called </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anthropocene</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This new epoch is defined as the age of humans. For some commentators latest buzzword, for scientist mostly a new taxonomic item for categorizing the world in the Aristotelian tradition, whereas for humanities and arts it is a potent metaphor, a new great meta narrative showing us how the accumulative consequences of human actions are so vast that Mother Nature is telling us: “go my children, go, you have matured, you are on your own now”. Indeed, it seems we have superseded Mother Nature in the leading role and now we have the power to shape our world according to our own image. We live in a ‘man-made’ world—a world that is predominantly shaped by human activity, and therefore we can re-name the anthropocene as the age of human intention, or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the age of design</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We interact with physical and biological systems in the way that we can already manipulate them and re-define what is possible. For instance, the field </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">synthetic biology</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where the leading academic and designer, Neri Oxman, creates 3D printed skins for interplanetary travels with before never-seen materials;</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\"><iframe style=\"max-width: 854px; width: 100%; height: 480px;\" src=\"https://embed-ssl.ted.com/talks/lang/cs/neri_oxman_design_at_the_intersection_of_technology_and_biology.html\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or the artist and real cyborg Neil Harbisson who, being colorblind, uses a sensor-antenna attached to the back of his skull in order to transcode visual images into sound waves which his brain learnt to interpret as visual stimuli. But he went further and can “see” infrared and ultraviolet spectrum, thus expanding the normal human capabilities.</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\"><iframe style=\"max-width: 854px; width: 100%; height: 480px;\" src=\"https://embed-ssl.ted.com/talks/neil_harbisson_i_listen_to_color.html\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the human activity is now the dominant planetary force and influences the physical and biological systems, why talk about these systems separately? Where the concept of Anthropocene is most powerful is in realizing that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all systems are social systems</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of which we are both objects and subjects — agents of great power. Researches have accepted a consensus (Stockholm Memorandum, 2011) that human intervention has intervened in all aspects of the planetary ecology, rendering even natural and ecological systems socially influenced. But are we willing to take the responsibility for our actions? And if Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams demand that we </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">re-purpose</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the technology, how do we ensure that we will do that correctly, without destructive unintended consequences of unwise decisions?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Architect and professor of design Harold G. Nelson writes:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8222;As scientist or humanities scholars are looked to for advice on preferred actions in response to large scale and complex issues they are essentially being asked to become </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">design consultants</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Unfortunately descriptions and explanations — the role of the sciences and the humanities — </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">do not prescribe</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And predictions and control — the contributions of technology and applied arts — do not justify action. The formulation [&#8230;] and justification of intentional actions comes through designers creating designs on behalf of others.&#8220;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps before we proceed to answer why designers seem to have a privilege status over others, we should clarify what we mean by the word </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">design</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defining design is essential, since there is still mythology and many falsehoods around the word. The cause is the ingrained misunderstanding of design as being solely about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">objects</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the artistic, subjective and mystical process called creativity. Although creativity is involved, such description is an immense simplification.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The late Czech-born philosopher Vilem Flusser asserts that design creates a bridge between soft and hard sciences, being an internal link between art and science.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This understanding of design has been severed since Renaissance, making the designer “only” a craftsman or artisan. It was the famous German school Bauhaus where re-unification of design as the link between art and technology took place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nigel Cross compares design with science and writes that whereas scientific method describes a pattern of behaviour for solving problem which science uses for discovering what in nature already exists, design is a pattern of behaviour or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">thinking </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for creating things that are not yet in existence. He concludes that science is analytical, design constructive or synthetic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dichotomy analysis/synthesis calls for explanation. By analysis we mean the classical paradigm of scientific reductionism which tears apart any system to its atomic elements which are analysed in isolation through their properties. In other words, analytical approach treats any system as a mere sum of individual elements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Synthesis, on the other hand, is a paradigm emphasizing the holistic approach, which gains understanding of the given system by looking at the relations and connections between individual components, acknowledging that systems exist in a broader, changing context, possibly with feedback loops.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, in systems exist synergies of elements that give rise to the emergent properties. We find a well-known example of emergence in water. While it makes no sense to talk about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wetness </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of hydrogen or oxygen, it is their combination that gives rise to such emergent property. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, under synthetic or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">systemic </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">thinking, the system is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a mere sum of its parts, it is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than the sum of its parts. This design, systemic thinking is in fact something that is also called </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">soft systems thinking</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given that we find ourselves in anthropocene where all systems are social systems and given the systemic approach of design, it is no coincidence that we can see designers promoted to positions where they create complex business strategies, organizational structures and are often used for complex social systems, policy-making and community design.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This shift from artifacts and communication to designing organizational and social transformation is best visualized by Jones and van Patter in their graph of four dimensions of design:</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Eg6QgbHZ5iBKiZHcGosIVrpU_u8bpCuNsIRkNgptm3R4OkIW5P-hdWIh30GXj_Es5M86G9EMbK_RO9KC9QxCdt585auoLomMmtnvao7JfJW1s2pk0tWYeMPIgBglB4EaIthfxKUVgQ.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-550\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-550\" style=\"width: 262px;\" src=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Eg6QgbHZ5iBKiZHcGosIVrpU_u8bpCuNsIRkNgptm3R4OkIW5P-hdWIh30GXj_Es5M86G9EMbK_RO9KC9QxCdt585auoLomMmtnvao7JfJW1s2pk0tWYeMPIgBglB4EaIthfxKUVgQ.png\" alt=\"Eg6QgbHZ5iBKiZHcGosIVrpU_u8bpCuNsIRkNgptm3R4OkIW5P-hdWIh30GXj_Es5M86G9EMbK_RO9KC9QxCdt585auoLomMmtnvao7JfJW1s2pk0tWYeMPIgBglB4EaIthfxKUVgQ\" width=\"262\" height=\"539\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Eg6QgbHZ5iBKiZHcGosIVrpU_u8bpCuNsIRkNgptm3R4OkIW5P-hdWIh30GXj_Es5M86G9EMbK_RO9KC9QxCdt585auoLomMmtnvao7JfJW1s2pk0tWYeMPIgBglB4EaIthfxKUVgQ.png 262w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Eg6QgbHZ5iBKiZHcGosIVrpU_u8bpCuNsIRkNgptm3R4OkIW5P-hdWIh30GXj_Es5M86G9EMbK_RO9KC9QxCdt585auoLomMmtnvao7JfJW1s2pk0tWYeMPIgBglB4EaIthfxKUVgQ-146x300.png 146w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Four dimensions of design, the third and fourth are focus of systemic design</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li><b> Artifacts and communications</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></li>\n<li><b>Products and services:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (including service design, product innovation user experience) </span></li>\n<li><b>Organizational transformation (complex, bounded by business or strategy):</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> change-oriented, design of work practices, strategies, and organizational structures</span></li>\n<li><b> Social transformation (complex, unbounded):</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> design for complex societal situations, social systems, policy-making, and community design.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These four dimensions do not exclude each other. It is a commonplace that designers working on higher dimensions will draw from experience and knowledge of lower ones.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having visualized the four dimensions of design, we can finally see why conceptualizing design as an activity producing tangible objects is an extremely limited view. Such definition would incorporate approximately first two dimensions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The better definition of design is to propose that design is a synthesising process of defining relationships and making connection between things, humans or ideas, so that they function as a system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we called systemic design is not a design discipline per se (in a sense that would generate a tangible product), but rather integration of systems thinking and design methods which bring human-centered approach to complex problems at the third and fourth dimension of design. By complex problems we mean situations where it is nearly inconceivable that any single expert or manager can understand the entire system, let alone suggest a solution. Such problems have emergent properties, rendering it impossible to make design or management decisions based on sufficient individual knowledge (which practically means that any politician has almost zero chance to solve any significant problems).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These complex design problems received its own name. Theoretician Horst Rittel called them “wicked problems”, because they cannot be analysed or reduced with classical analytical problem solving methods and techniques. Apart from their sheer complexity, one of the reasons being that wicked problems consist of a human element, so it is necessary to negotiate between frequently conflicting demands. However, calling these complex situations “problems” might be misleading, because the most difficult part in solving wicked problems is to know what they actually are, and that requires mapping and visualizing the whole ecology of a system. Otherwise we may not realise how they are interrelated to other components of the system and due to the feedback loops, changing one component can yield catastrophic results in other places.</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wicked-problems.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-562\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-562\" src=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wicked-problems.png\" alt=\"wicked-problems\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wicked-problems.png 800w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wicked-problems-300x225.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wicked-problems-768x576.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>\nDefinitions of wicked problems, Source: Systemic Design Principles for Complex Social Systems, Peter H.

One canonical example that should deter anyone is the work of famous Swiss architect Le Corbusier who was commissioned to re-design Paris. His vision had little to do with human needs, instead he created technocratic solution deprived of organic elements, which epitomises a city we may find in any dystopian literature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of human-centred design is not new, Scandinavian designers have been using participatory design methods, involving extensive cooperation with potential users, since 1970s, but it was the US design agency IDEO that pushed HCD into mainstream as a tool for solving complex business and social problems.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there are interesting cases where HCD is used at the level of government to improve social services, one such case is the Danish design agency Mindlab, nowadays, even according to academic literature, HCD seems to have become a buzzword sold by companies as a new thing just to improve company’s image.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the creativity  of design profession has been in last decades again diminished into making small, incremental changes, fearing to change the status quo of products that are selling. With the increase of virtual reality, there is also a chance that designers will work as “master designers” of a personalized virtual word, designing our virtual avatars and the whole virtual experience: safe virtual havens where we can hide from the harshness of reality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that was to be expected. If technology is inherently political, the same holds for design, since it is design whose methods are applied to developing technology. Repurposing technology must be inevitably preceded by repurposing design. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams suggest that we need a tool for cognitive mapping of the intangible, non-object, that is the economic system. Why not appropriate the tools that design already has?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Oslo School of Architecture and Design, the current epicentre for the research in systemic design, they developed a tool for mapping super-complex problems called GIGA-mapping. Created by designers with strong visual skills, these GIGA-maps provide a visual guide through the full context of a problem. They reveal unexpected relations between multiple layers, scales and design dimensions, from individual objects and humans to society.</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/XCxl2lu67DqXHDe45bwLKmLuuUFYeKtT9zk8VFVmC3reBimVo1ht8aFhkMxH4wMqEOsGlYJcLb3nciCTMhfPmBgcY_X_1OHp7-d7fsMWSOKWOE_xVwu94wWR34Xfi717gF6AowPTRg.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-552\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-552\" src=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/XCxl2lu67DqXHDe45bwLKmLuuUFYeKtT9zk8VFVmC3reBimVo1ht8aFhkMxH4wMqEOsGlYJcLb3nciCTMhfPmBgcY_X_1OHp7-d7fsMWSOKWOE_xVwu94wWR34Xfi717gF6AowPTRg-1024x608.png\" alt=\"XCxl2lu67DqXHDe45bwLKmLuuUFYeKtT9zk8VFVmC3reBimVo1ht8aFhkMxH4wMqEOsGlYJcLb3nciCTMhfPmBgcY_X_1OHp7-d7fsMWSOKWOE_xVwu94wWR34Xfi717gF6AowPTRg\" width=\"660\" height=\"392\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/XCxl2lu67DqXHDe45bwLKmLuuUFYeKtT9zk8VFVmC3reBimVo1ht8aFhkMxH4wMqEOsGlYJcLb3nciCTMhfPmBgcY_X_1OHp7-d7fsMWSOKWOE_xVwu94wWR34Xfi717gF6AowPTRg-1024x608.png 1024w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/XCxl2lu67DqXHDe45bwLKmLuuUFYeKtT9zk8VFVmC3reBimVo1ht8aFhkMxH4wMqEOsGlYJcLb3nciCTMhfPmBgcY_X_1OHp7-d7fsMWSOKWOE_xVwu94wWR34Xfi717gF6AowPTRg-300x178.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/XCxl2lu67DqXHDe45bwLKmLuuUFYeKtT9zk8VFVmC3reBimVo1ht8aFhkMxH4wMqEOsGlYJcLb3nciCTMhfPmBgcY_X_1OHp7-d7fsMWSOKWOE_xVwu94wWR34Xfi717gF6AowPTRg-768x456.png 768w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/XCxl2lu67DqXHDe45bwLKmLuuUFYeKtT9zk8VFVmC3reBimVo1ht8aFhkMxH4wMqEOsGlYJcLb3nciCTMhfPmBgcY_X_1OHp7-d7fsMWSOKWOE_xVwu94wWR34Xfi717gF6AowPTRg.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>GIGA-mapping helps visualising super-complex problems and relations between components</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are GIGA-maps the cognitive mapping the authors call for?

If not powerful enough to map the whole socio-economical system, the technique can be used for mapping smaller parts of our lives: voting system, system of taxes, relations between governmental bodies, the flow of money in public spending etc. Whereas rigorous mathematical modelling might be unpopular among the Left, this so-called “soft” approach to systems is certainly more accessible, not only to the theoreticians, but also the general population.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Systemic design should not be viewed as a new political salvation, rather it is a set of conceptual, formal tools and methods that could bring creative, yet systemic, abstract thinking and reasoning about capitalism to the contemporary Left politics.

Chudák Text, jak jen může konkurovat televizním pořadům ve full HD obrazu, videohrám či interaktivním webovým stránkám, jež představují supermédium, neboť dokáží pojmout text, obraz, video, zvuk, ba dokonce i samotné videohry. Máme-li být objektivní, je zřejmé, že text sám o sobě je dost archaickou záležitostí. Až příliš rychlé a nekritické osvojení si nových technologíí (médií) ale paradoxně způsobilo, že práce s textem, tedy čtení, je potřeba nikoli méně, ale možná více než kdy dříve.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pro odůvodnění takového tvrzení je ale třeba vědět, co vlastně čtení je. Jako první si jistě představíme namáhavý mechanický pohyb očí, smyslového orgánu — jež je poprávu chápán a obdivován jako zázrak evoluce —, kterým sledujeme řádky textu, následně rozpoznáváme změť znaků, ukládáme si jejich zvuk do krátkodobé paměti, a nakonec si formujeme mentální obraz přečteného, což nám napomáhá v dlouhodobém zapamatování. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Čtení ale lze pojmout obecněji, nemusí mít (zdánlivě) nic společného s jazykem. Často si vážíme, když blízká osoba dokáže rozpoznat, jak se zrovna cítíme, aniž bychom museli explicitně zmínit naše pocity. Ona osoba v takovém případě </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">čte</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> emoce nebo je taktéž schopna </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">číst </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">naše myšlenky. Nejen, že si všimne subtilních grimas v našem obličeji, ale hlavně dokáže dekódovat jejich význam. A to je, pokud se zamyslíme, až magická schopnost, jelikož naše tváře neodkrývají nic uchopitelného kromě změn ve svalech obličeje nebo tónu hlasu. U dekódování těchto non-verbálních znaků ale už nehovoříme o čtení v pasivním slova smyslu, ale o aktivní činnosti </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interpretace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Podobně při čtení textu si nevystačíme pouze se sledováním řádků slov. Z těchto lingvistických znaků nejdříve musíme v mysli poslepovat vyšší celky, prozkoumat, jaký mají mezi sebou vztah, jak na sebe navazují. K tomu nevyhnutelně potřebujeme vědět, co tyto vyšší celky znamenají. K vytvoření koherentního mentálního obrazu textu je nutné „vypreparovat“ jeho význam, tedy text interpretovat. I proto je čtení namáhavou aktivitou vyžadující míru dovednosti, tréninku, znalosti, dobrou paměť a v neposlední řadě schopnost se soustředit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Na druhé straně sledování televizoru či videa na YouTube od nás žádají poněkud méně, konzumace jejich obsahu je přívětivější, více nám promine nepozornost. Čím to? Vilém Flusser argumentuje, že obrazy přijímáme a pak je analyzujeme, text je ale nutné nejdříve přijmout, aby ho vůbec bylo možné analyzovat. Čtení písmen vyžaduje:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">větší námahu než čtení [obrazů], je nepohodlnější. Proto znemožňuje nekritické přijímání informací. Sledování řádků je kritickou gymnastikou myšlení (Flusser, 79).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obrazy, statické i pohyblivé, se nám do vědomí dostávají v celku, zatímco čtení textu je jako postupné namotávání nitě na klubko. Anebo si čtení můžeme představit jako práci hrnčířky, jež během stálého otáčení hrnčířského kruhu svými prsty postupně tvaruje výsledný výrobek. Stejně tak čtenář málokdy končí s knihou po prvním kole čtení. Průměrná kniha o průměrné délce volá po tom, aby se k ní čtenář po nějaké době vrátil, prozkoumal zákoutí, která mu při prvním dotyku s textem unikla, doplnil si dílky mentálního obrazu, jež po prvním čtení zůstal nevyplněný, nezformovaný, nedokončený. Čtení přirozeně obsahuje jak analýzu, tak i syntézu, čímž čtenář v sobě ztělesňuje vědecké i umělecké vnímání světa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bylo by velmi pošetilé si myslet, že bychom dokázali hned napoprvé odkrýt veškerá zákoutí textu, který pro nás autor přichystal. Je pravděpodobné, že autor textu bude vzdělanější a sofistikovanější než čtenář a čtení jeho myšlenek bude vyžadovat soustředění a pozornost k nepatrným detailům. I když tyto podmínky nepsané smlouvy dialogu mezi autorem a čtenářem splníme, nemusíme se dočkat kladného výsledku a nezbude nám nic jiného, než text číst znovu a znovu, dokud pomyslná keramická nádoba nebude jasná, pevná a celá. Jeden z největších estétů prózy 20. století, Vladimir Nabokov, ve své známé eseji </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good Readers and Good Writers</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> definuje, že dobrý čtenář by měl kromě jiného mít: dobrou paměť, představivost, umělecké cítění a také přitakává Flusserovi, když píše, že: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">„Nemáme žádný fyzický orgán (jako máme oko v případě malby), který pojme celý obraz [textu] a dokáže se těšit ze všech jeho podrobností. Ale po druhém, třetím, nebo čtvrtém čtení se v určitém smyslu stavíme ke knize stejným způsobem, jako se stavíme k malbě.“ </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pro Nabokova čtenář není pasivním konzumentem knihy, ale kolegou, s nímž sdílí talent pro představivost a umělecké cítění. Vždyť čtenář musí krok za krokem opět vztyčit pilíře imaginárního světa, jehož původ najdeme v mysli autora. Na čtenáři je, aby oživil budovy, rozsáhlé louky, šum lesů a barvy zvuků, musí si umět představit šaty hlavních postav, jejich tváře, oči, parfém a šarm. Prostřednictvím tichých a mrtvých znaků na stránce knihy resuscitujeme pouhými myšlenkami celý svět — kompetence náležící původně jen Bohům většiny světových náboženství (pokud jsme byli podle starozákonní knihy Genesis stvořeni Bohem k jeho obrazu, je psaní a čtení textu fiktivního světa božskou aktivitou, případně nelze Boha chápat jako prvního a posledního velkého umělce, literáta, poetu, jehož kreativní síla zatím nebyl pokořena?).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jistě, velkolepost světa se liší podle dané knihy a záleží i na zvoleném žánru textu. Krásná literatura vyobrazuje konkrétní svět, kdežto esej v nás vzbudí spíše obrazy abstraktní, mířené na naše intelektuální já, kde mlhavost abstrakcí je nutno překódovat, konkretizovat, vizualizovat. Pochopení textu eseje mi v leččems připomíná proces ne nepodobný vnímání avant-gardní poezie: surrealistická či symbolická škola básnictví nám předkládá sérii obrazů a je na čtenáři, aby z těchto disparátních tahů štětce složil celistvou strukturu; esejista zas sestavuje logicky uspořádanou linii argumentů a myšlenek, takže struktura je už přítomna, avšak málokdy je prezentována jako lehce zobrazitelný obsah. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toto rozdělení není samozřejmě univerzálně platné. Krásná literatura sice „od antiky až po román devatenáctého století věrně kopíruje rétorické předpisy zaměřené na průkaznou živost (enargeia) a jasnost (safenéia) představy, kterou mysl odvíjí z nabídnutého popisu“ (Císar a Koťátko, 71), ale (velká) krásná literatura by se nikterak nelišila od žánru popisné žurnalistiky, pokud by nedokázala přejít přes všednost, každodennost, a nereprezentovala by to, co není možné popsat, co se vymyká rozumovému pojmosloví, to čemu filosofie a literární kritika říká </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Sublime</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Navíc autoři jako Samuel Beckett měli za svůj kreativní program tvorbu děl, kde obraznost textu bude umrtvena, tvary a pevnost objektů rozmělněny ve světě bez ošklivosti nebo krásy nebo horečnosti, „budou neživé (almost lifeless)“. Beckett redukuje vizuální prvky na minimum a co zbývá, je scenérie jakoby ve světě po konci světa. (Císař, 76) Beckettova próza je proto velice těžká na čtení a tím pádem také na interpretaci. Text tu neslouží  jako zprostředkovávající médium, neboť čtenář velice těžko dokáže nahlédnout za gramatiku a tvar jednotlivých vět, jež s potem na spáncích čte, čeká, až se dostaví obrazy, ony však nepřicházejí. Jeho texty se proto stávají autonomními objekty: text pro text, gramatika pro gramatiku, zvuky pro zvuky, umění pro umění.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A na druhé straně žánr eseje může a často využívá tradičních literárních figur a konkretizace mentálních obrazů. To je taktéž obsah knihy </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sense of Style </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">amerického kognitivního vědce a lingvisty Stevena Pinkera, který ve svém novodobé příručce stylistiky čerpá ze současného poznání kognitivních věd a argumentuje, že jedním z předpokladů dobrého stylu psaní (non-fiction) prózy, je limitovat abstraktní vyjadřování na nutné minimum a naopak využívat podstatná jména konkrétní z důvodu, že čtenář si dokáže lépe vizualizovat a pamatovat, o čem text vypovídá.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nezapomínejme, že v textu máme přístup nejen k neživým objektům a faktům, ale také k historickému vědomí světa. Byl to text, který poprvé osvobodil člověka od nekonečné přítomnosti a dovolil předávat znalosti a zkušenosti dalším generacím, jež nemusely procházet životem zcela od počátku, ale mohly stavět na tom, co si prožily jejich předci. Text a konkrétněji literatura v podání mistrů a mistryň jako Shakespeare, Dante, Chaucer, Cervantes, Austen, Eliot (George i T. S.), Dickens, Proust, Joyce, Kafka dokáží mysl přenášet na časoprostorové přímce do oblastí nám reálně zapovězených: každá velká literatura je myšlenkovým experimentem, virtuální realitou, kde se optikou voyerského omnipotentního oka (v hantýrce online videoher „spectatora“), nebo avatara jedné z postav, vžíváme do rolí jiných postav, čímž tím trénujeme schopnosti empatie (KIDD, D. C. a E. Castano). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vzpomeňme si třeba na hlavní postavu z jedné z Dickensových knih, Pipa, jenž se za velmi zamotaných podmínek stal vlastníkem nemalého jmění a mladým džentlemanem s nadějnými vyhlídkami. Dickens pro nás připravil morální dilema, kdy na jedné straně přejeme Pipovi nový život, avšak musíme odsoudit jeho chování, když se zjevně stydí za svého starého kamaráda, dobráka a nevlastního otce, kováře Joea. Dickens se ptá: jak byste reagovali vy? Přestože se jedná o fikci, virtuální svět, klade před nás reálnou otázku, jejíž zodpovězení (pro vnímavější) může mít zásadní vliv na reálným život.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Literární kritik Harold Bloom píše, že čteme z mnoha důvodů; mezi těmi nejfrekventovanějšími se skrývá maxima „hranic jednoho lidského života“, kdy ať už čteme cokoli, vždy na nás každým odbitím hodin dopadá tíha času a toho, že během jednoho krátkého života nelze „poznat dostatečně mnoho lidí dostatečně dobře; že se potřebujeme poznat lépe, což vyžaduje znalosti nejen sebe sama a ostatních, ale také toho, jak se věci mají“ (Bloom). Pro Blooma je čtení literatury v první řadě „obtížnou zábavou“, aktivitou, kdy se ponořujeme do díla, abychom se nechali omámit géniem autora, jehož konstrukce fiktivního světa a navození silných a autentických emocí nás dokáží vytrhnout z normálnosti, kterou jsme obklopeni. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jenomže emoce a intelekt máme každý nastavený trochu jinak, a pokud je dílo až příliš vzdálené naší všednosti, nastavá problém, že okouzlení se transformuje na frustraci, někdy dokonce i na agresi vůči přílišnému intelektualismu. Výška laťky symbolizující nastavení těchto parametrů je ale vedle genetických předpokladů ovlivněna taktéž kulturou. Ta nabízí dvě možnosti: buďto půjde cestou obtížné zábavy, možná působící paternalisticky, neboť bude vzdělávat a chtít po nás překonávání vlastních limitů; nebo se bude jednat o zábavu lehce stravitelnou, předžvýkanou, vytvořenou tak, aby nám dopřála rychlou a levnou dávku dopingu, modré pilulky vydávané za červenou, jež nás má aspoň na chvíli odpojit od Matrixu verze 9-17.24.365, avšak jedinou její funkcí je, abychom zapomněli, že v Matrixu vůbec jsme.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(2)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obávám se, že nová média jsou vlastně podvod. Na první pohled se zdá, že pouze využívají starých médií (text, fotografie) a přidávají k ním díky existujícím technologiím dříve netušené možnosti. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tak například již starý dobrý Text v sobě obsahoval zárodečnou formu </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hypertextu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: apoštolové Nového zákona se hojně </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">odkazují</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> na pasáže Zákona starého (v počátcích křesťanství by Starý zákon byl vždy na předních pozicích vyhledávače Google), neboť dva celky textu spojuje obsahová i logická podobnost, čehož využívali noví prorokové, jež </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">linkovali</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> své kázání se starozákonním kontextem, čímž dokazovali, že toto (sebenaplňující se) proroctví je grandiózní náplní božského plánu. Ale teprve v jednadvacátém století mohou existovat osobní proroctví, řízena a kázána nikoli v sermonech, ale v kontextuálních reklamách Google AdWords a jim podobných. Máme tak pocit, že celý digitální svět je nám podřízen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nejedná se ale o největší klam nových médií; ten hledejme v jejich apropriaci Textu, což není aktem rozšíření jeho stávajících možností, ale destrukcí základních vlastností: </span><b>mentální obraznosti a nutnosti interpretace</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Jako příklad, kde tato anihilace nastala, uvedu webové stránky a populární YouTube videa, ale jelikož se jedná o globální fenomén adikce na Rychlosti (Speed), pomyslné drobky nás v podstatě zavedenou do všech koutů dnešní společnosti.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Řekl jsem, že čtení lze chápat i obecněji; v takovém případě i sledování videa a brouzdání na Webu chápu jako </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">čtení </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">videa a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">čtení </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interaktivních webových stránek, neboť teoretický model toho, jak probíhá komunikace mezi člověkem a obsahem zprostředkovaným daným médiem (jež nemusí nutně obsahovat text), se skládá z několika kroků: navázání komunikace, přenos obsahu, přijmutí obsahu, dekódování obsahu a následná interpretace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nová média bohužel mají ve své DNA zakódováno, aby se co nejvíce vyhýbala tomu být čtena, ve smyslu býti interpretována. Nevychází to z jejich inherentní technologické limitace, ale socio-kulturní volby, kterou jsme zvolili. Proč zrovna socio-kulturní? Teoretici zabývající se filosofií či sociologií technologií poznamenávají, že technologie neexistuje mimo společnosti, ale je její integrální součástí. Jinak řečeno, vývoj technologie není nějakým nevyhnutelným, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">determinovaným</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> procesem; naopak je formována tím, kdo a za jakým účelem ji vytváří. Tvůrcemi jsou jednotliví lidé. Ti jsou samozřejmě opět součástí širšího socio-kulturního kontextu. Nakonec lidé jsou zpětně ovlivňováni technologií.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Když ze své kanceláře ve švýcarském vědeckém centru Tim Berners-Lee spustil první webovou stránku, obsahovala pouze text, zbarvený převážně do černé barvy, ale některá slova a fráze byla zvýrazněna modře. To byly první </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">linky</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hyper-textového projektu, kterým WorldWideWeb byl a přeze všechny nevýhody oproti konkurenčním řešením (např. Xanadu) stále je.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Postupem času se z jednoho malého projektu pro sdílení informací mezi vědci stala platforma, obsahující už nejen hyper-text, ale také multimediální prvky (fotografie, video, zvuk), odtud také plyne mezi lajky nepříliš používané slovo </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hypermédia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> = hypertext + multimédia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Webová stránka se z kontejneru na text přeměnila na digitální umělecké plátno, jelikož kdekoli figurují multimédia a text, naskytá se poptávka po tom, aby tyto prvky byly vhodně uspořádány. Web se s příchodem fotografií, videí a zvuk stal prostorem, které bylo třeba </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">designovat</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A tím nemyslím vybrat vhodné barvy; design je </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">myšlení</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, jež syntetizuje, dává dohromady, různorodé prvky tak, aby vytvářely jednotný, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dobrý</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tvar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Grafický design toto myšlení aplikuje na vizuální komunikaci. nelze jednoznačně a vyčerpávajícím způsobem říci, co přesně grafický design je; jako operativní definici ale věřím, že v základu se jedná o vizuální komunikaci (odtud „grafický“), tedy grafický design je třeba „vidět“ pro to, aby mohla komunikace nastavat. Co rozhodně nelze říci je, jak tato komunikace má konkrétně vypadat, pouze věřím, že komunikace má být úspěšná. Jakým způsobem ale grafický designér úspěšnou komunikaci navodí, to závisí na jeho rozhodnutí. Cest k úspěšné komunikaci je mnoho: cesta může být kostrbatá a klikatá, nebo naopak uhlazená, a tudíž lehce stravitelná. Na povrchnu snad paradoxně je třeba za úspěšnou komunikaci považovat i komunikaci neúspěšnou. Jak je to možné? Pokud cílem designéra je navodit pocit strachu, zmatení, agrese, odmítnutí a skutečně prostřednictvím jeho díla čtenář-divák zamýšleným způsobem reaguje, komunikace z pohledu designéra proběhla úspěšně.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Této </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">úspěšné-neúspěšné</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> komunikace se ale běžně nedočkáme. Pouze ve výjimečných případech, jako umělecký akt či rádoby avant-gardní marketingová kampaň, se webová stránka zcela vědomě snaží o zmatení, nepochopení či zamítnutí komunikace. Designér má se čtenářem-divákem nevyslovenou dohodu, že jeho dílo musí být pouze takové, aby </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">úspěšná-úspěšná</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> komunikace převažovala. Proč tomu tak je?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Žijeme v dlouhodobé a nevědomé závislosti na stále se zvyšující Rychlosti. Chceme-li zůstat relevantní, jsme nuceni (s naším souhlasem) kopírovat křivku produktivity vyžadovanou společností. Čím více relevantní a viditelná naše pozice je, tím více exponenciální zakulacení křivky pociťujeme. Je pravdou, že nás přímo nikdo pod krkem nedrží, abychom na této jízdě participovali; avšak, teoretická svoboda je banálním výrokem na papíře, jestliže neexistují prostředky na její realizaci. Mnohokrát jsem slyšel od strážců svobody zcela extrémní věty jako: „každý může bydlet mimo město, dokonce mimo civilizaci, kde požadavky na podřízení se Rychlost neexistují“. Tyto představy jsou formou extrémismu, ti, jež je vyslovují, ale simultánně plně věří ve svobodu, značně redukovaný význam svobody.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jdeme s dobou, jdeme se společností. Abychom neztratili své postavení, nebo už jako pouhé gesto rezignace, jsme konstantně připojeni: vstaneme, podíváme se na obrazovku; při přemisťování, sledujeme obrazovku; když pracujeme, je to s obrazovkou; když jdeme spát, usínáme s obrazovkou. Kdysi to byla výsada geeků a majetných, dnes je to nutnost pro všechny. Chcete proti tomu něco dělat? Přesuňte se do lesa! To bychom slyšeli od extrémistů prosazujících tzv. svobodu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nechceme, ale musíme. Takto zní definice závislosti, když jde do tuhého. Momentálně jsme ale stále ve fázi, kdy </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chceme</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, neboť </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">není čas </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">si uvědomit, že nechceme.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naši pra-pra-předkové žili v neustálé přítomnosti, protože jim chybělo historické vědomí.

Jinak řečeno, funkce Textu a interpretace bude redukována a uvidíme proliferaci médií pro přenos informací umožňujích nekritické přijmutí a zpracování: fotografie a videa.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(4)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mnoho tvůrců webových stránek slyšelo, že návštěvníci obsah </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nečtou, ale skenují</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, čekají, až se jim na obrazovce objeví něco, co zaujme jejich pozornost, pokud v daném čase nic takového nenastane, stránku opustí. Momentální limit tohoto času je kolem pěti vteřin. Tvůrci webových stránek, vědomi si potřeby hned zaujmout, rozhodně tak nešáhnou po textových informací. Proto dnes vidíme na každé stránce přes celou stránku fotografie a videa. Je pravdou, že se říká, že obraz dokáže říct tisíc slov, ale důvodem pro tento postup tvorby webových stránek není nutně potřeba něco říci, často není ani co, ale jednoduše se vtěsnat do oněch šibeničních pěti vteřin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Připomíná mi to situaci, kdy se novinář v jednom z rozhovorů dotázal Noama Chomského, proč si myslí, že není pozván do známých pořadů hlavního proudu vysílání. Jeho odpovědí bylo, že tyto pořady mají chytře zvolený požadavek na stručnost hostů, což je ideální metoda na to, aby mnoho hlasů bylo z pořadu ignorováno, vyloučeno, případně, aby se sami před díváky zdiskreditovali. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Je totiž obtížné předložit argumenty čerpající z informací, které diváci nebo posluchači nikdy neslyšeli. Málokdo se pozastaví nad tím, když někdo pronese, že Spojené státy jsou kolébkou demokracie. Pokud ale někdo v přímém přenosu vysloví, že Spojené státy jsou teroristickým státem a hrozbou světa, nebudou vědět, o čem se mluví a budou zcela přirozeně požadovat vysvětlení. Zde se ale projeví genialita požadavku na stručnost: host nemůže vyslovit kontroverzní větu, aniž by přitom nevyzněl, jako že právě spadl z Neptunu. Je to forma cenzury, často autocenzury. Ten, kdo chce mluvit, vysvětlovat, přinést něco nového je odsouzen do ústranní, undergroundu.

Táži se, je hrozivější, že životy a touhy statisíců lze vyjádřit čtyřmi archetypy, nebo že někdo přistoupil na to, že tento způsob obohatí životy jednotlivců, a tím i společnosti jako celku? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ještě nedávno jsme věřili, že jednotlivec je unikátní lidskou bytostí. Ve skutečnosti tento fakt je ultimátním nepřítelem každého průmyslového odvětví: vytvářet personalizované produkty pro miliardu lidí je příliš drahé, takže se zdá být mnohem levnější investovat do chytré marketingové kampaně, jež tuto miliardu přesvědčí, že chtějí jedno a to samé. Jakmile se toto jednou přihodí, komodifikaci kultury začne v celé společnosti snižovat entropii, až nakonec veškeré rozdíly překročí horizont černé díry, odkud není návratu a neuspořádanost, čas, i bytí zamrzají.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tento rozklad je akcelerován tím, že větší konformita je doprovázena vyšším zjednodušováním. Kdo je ochotný přenést se přes ekonomický diktát statusu quo a zavést opravdu něco nového? Historie ukazuje, že nejvlivnější projekty byly vždy závislé na dotacích od štědré matky — Státu. I kdyby se našel kapitál, bude někdo naslouchat? Originálním věcem rozumíme špatně, vyžadují interpretaci, reflexi, internalizaci, převod do Texu a zasazení do struktury předešlého poznání. Na to pět vteřin ale nestačí.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(5)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obraz z výše uvedených důvodů dominuje naší kultuře.

Stačí pouze mít funkční oční orgán a příslušné části mozku zodpovědné za zpracování elektrických signálů ze sítnice. To jsou ale činnosti na vědomí zcela nezávislé, tudíž neprocházejí filtry intelektu. Jinak řečeno, není nutné nic dělat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obraz se jeví sám od sebe, celý jeho obsah je okamžitě přístupný, a pokud není doplněn literárním nádechem (metaforou, ironií, atd.), jediné, interpretace se stává z jednoduchého vyjmenování toho, co na obrazu je. Přímost obraznosti obrazů se vybízí nazvat </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pornografickou</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> vlastností obraznosti obrazů.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redukujeme-li množství Textu ve společnosti, ošizujeme se o schopnost představovat si na základě lineárního kódu Textu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ano, konstruované mentální obrazy z Textu jsou nedokonalé, v mnoha ohledech spíše metaforické či abstraktní. Ona nedokonalost ale přispívá k rozšiřování intelektu, neboť si vytváříme vlastní nové obrazy, vizuální spojení, subjektivní nehotové objekty, které aplikujeme na nové poznatky, jež zabalíme do zmíněných nehotových objektů, spojení, obrazů z naší produkce, a tak můžeme přijít s originálními myšlenkami.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokud ale toto obrazotvorství odstraníme z intelektuálního procesu a nahradíme jej předpřipravenými, vyrenderovanými objekty na filmovém plátně či obrazovce, nic nového si nevytváříme, pouze přijímáme objekty tak, jak jsou. Dalo by se říci, že jsme odkázáni na kreativitu a schopnost grafických umělců, jež tyto objekty (animované postavy, scény) navrhují. Jinak řečeno, svou obrazotvorbu </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">outsourcujeme </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">do rukou (hlavy) někoho jiného. To je nebezpečné z několika důvodů: degraduje to naší mysl a také to našemu vědomí vnucuje obsah, který nemůžeme přijmout kriticky: u čtení textů si sami diktujeme, jak si autorovy myšlenky vyobrazíme. Zbývá nám tak jediný způsob, jak se bránit nakažlivým cizorodým obrazům — zavřít oči.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HAROLD BLOOM. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to read and why</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. 1. paperback ed.

Předtím, než se v CERNu rozhodl vyřešit jednou pro vždy problémy se sdílením informací, pracoval na několika minoritních projektech. Berners-Lee byl například povolán, aby vytvořil uživatelsky přívětivější ovládání systému pro propagaci vakua <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"GILLIES a CAILLIAU, How the Web was born: the story of the World Wide Web, s. 158\" id=\"return-note-511-1\" href=\"#note-511-1\"><sup>1</sup></a>. Místo toho, aby na obrazovce — o 24 řádcích s limitem 64 znaků na každém z nich — zobrazil najednou celý ovládací interface systému, rozhodl se vytvořit něco, co bychom nazvali „menu“: na hlavní obrazovce ponechal jen zobrazení hlavních modulů systému a teprve po kliknutí na vybranou část se operátor dostal na „podstránku“, kde byly dostupné relevantní komponenty.</p>\n<p>Zatímco výše zmíněný projekt neobsahoval žádné prvky hypertextu (snad až na možnost kliknutím zobrazit jinou část dokumentu), první projekt implementující model hypertextu byl ENQUIRE z roku 1980. ENQUIRE umožňoval „informace strukturovat jakýmkoli arbitrárním způsobem. Nemusely být zobrazovány ve stromové struktuře ani v sadě tabulek.“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Tamtéž, s. 170\" id=\"return-note-511-2\" href=\"#note-511-2\"><sup>2</sup></a>. ENQUIRE nabízel obousměrné odkazy, což je funkcionalita, která například v dnešní podobě platformy Webu chybí: stránka, na kterou je odkazováno, neví, že je na ni odkazováno. Dle Tima Bernerse-Lee <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"BERNERS-LEE, Frequently asked questions\" id=\"return-note-511-3\" href=\"#note-511-3\"><sup>3</sup></a> hlavním limitujícím faktorem tohoto projektu byla nemožnost odkazovat na externí zdroje; ENQUIRE podporoval odkazy mezi soubory i mezi částmi jednoho souboru. To vše ale v rámci jednoho souborového systému. Pokud chtěl Berners-Lee vytvořit skutečně globální informační systém, musel dostat ještě jednu šanci; tou šancí byl Word Wide Web.</p>\n<p>Jaké z dosavadně vyjmenovaných projektů ovlivnily Bernerse-Lee při návrhu a implementaci komponent Webu? Nepřímo jej ovlivnil Ted Nelson se svými Literary Machines; návrh NLS Douglase Engelbarta pak považuje k Webu nejblíže <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Tamtéž\" id=\"return-note-511-4\" href=\"#note-511-4\"><sup>4</sup></a>. Dozvídáme se, že hypertext byl okolo roku 1989 již obecně známou technologií; SGML pak bylo přímo v CERNu hojně využíváno pro tvorbu struktury interních dokumentů <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"GILLIES a CAILLIAU, How the Web was born: the story of the World Wide Web, s. 160\" id=\"return-note-511-5\" href=\"#note-511-5\"><sup>5</sup></a>. Zdá se, že Berners-Lee měl, i díky otestování a zpětné vazbě k projektu ENQUIRE, mnoho potřebného k tomu, aby začal pracovat na dnes nejpoužívanější službě sítě Internet — službě World Wide Web.</p>\n<p>Projekt „World Wide Web“, vytvořený v roce 1990, zahrnoval značkovací jazyk HTML, hypertextový protokol HTTP, mechanismus adresování dokumentů URI a prohlížeč. První webový prohlížeč, navržený Bernersem-Lee, se jmenoval „WorldWideWeb“ a nabízel unikátní funkci: oproti dnešním prohlížečům byl koncipován jako prohlížeč a editor zároveň; uživatelé tak pomocí tohoto grafického WYSIWYG <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Zkratka anglické fráze What You See Is What You Get\" id=\"return-note-511-6\" href=\"#note-511-6\"><sup>6</sup></a> nástroje mohli přímo během prohlížení stránky editovat <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"V prohlížečích nicméně nacházíme moduly, které umožňují „živé“ editování obsahu stránky. Zmiňme např. modul Firebug či Chrome Developer Tools.\" id=\"return-note-511-7\" href=\"#note-511-7\"><sup>7</sup></a>. Podrobnější analýzu platformy Webu provádíme v sekci Web jako technologická platforma.</p>\n<h2>Vývoj prvních webových prohlížečů</h2>\n<p>První webový prohlížeč — WorldWideWeb — byl navržený pro systém NeXT, který svým výkonem převyšoval výpočetní sílu strojů v běžných domácnostech. V roce 1992 pak vychází první (v celkovém pořadí druhý) multiplatformní prohlížeč Line mode. Nabídl pouze textový interface, a tudíž veškeré ovládání (přechod na jinou stránku) bylo nutné provést zadáním příslušného příkazu. Ve stejném roce vychází prohlížeč Erwise vyvinutý finským univerzitním týmem. Erwise je obvykle pojmenováván jako první prohlížeč s grafickým interface <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"V době psaní této práce anglická Wikipedia cituje několik zdrojů, které píší o Erwise jako prvním prohlížeči s grafickým interface.\" id=\"return-note-511-8\" href=\"#note-511-8\"><sup>8</sup></a>, nicméně, jak jsme mohli vidět, není tomu tak, neboť první grafický prohlížeč byl onen první prohlížeč vyvinutý Bernersem-Lee. Tato mystifikace spočívá nejspíše v tom, že Erwise skutečně drží určité prvenství: jednalo se o první prohlížeč pro okenní systém X-Window System (X11). Konkurenčním prohlížečem pro X11 byla Viola WWW. Pei-Yuan Wei, autor Violy WWW, se inspiroval projektem HyperCard od Apple. Jako Erwise také nabízela podporu více fontů, zvýraznění odkazů, tlačítka pro přechod vzad a vpřed, včetně tlačítka pro přechod na domovskou stránku. Jednotlivé stránky mohl uživatel „klonovat“ do nových oken. Viola také nabízela podporu zaznamenávání navštívených stránek a možnost stránku přidat do záložek. <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"BERNERS-LEE, An updated quick look at ViolaWWW\" id=\"return-note-511-9\" href=\"#note-511-9\"><sup>9</sup></a> Viola integrovala průlomovou podporu skriptování, vkládání apletů do těla stránky, vlastní verzi stylopisů a podporu HTML 3.0 standardu. <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"The Viola World Wide Web Application: 9.1 Features Highlight\" id=\"return-note-511-10\" href=\"#note-511-10\"><sup>10</sup></a></p>\n<p>Viola je příklad, kdy software obsahující na papíře delší seznam funkcionalit není zárukou toho, že bude v konkurenci s méně vyspělými produkty úspěšný. Neboť jsou to především uživatelé, kteří o úspěšnosti rozhodují; z historie designových hnutí jsme se dozvěděli, že použitelnost, uživatelská přívětivost, atraktivita i strmější křivka učení jsou faktory pro uživatele často důležitější. Legendární prohlížeč Mosaic, vytvořený Marcem Andreessenem při NCSA <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"National Center for Supercomputing Applications, University of Illinois (US)\" id=\"return-note-511-11\" href=\"#note-511-11\"><sup>11</sup></a>, je nejen považován za prohlížeč, který zpřístupnil Web masám, ale i prohlížeč, který přiblížil platformu Webu ke grafickému designu a DTP <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Desktop Publishing\" id=\"return-note-511-12\" href=\"#note-511-12\"><sup>12</sup></a>. Mosaic totiž jako první prohlížeč umožnil zobrazování obrázků přímo v dokumentu stránky. Všechny předcházející prohlížeče se vypořádávaly s obrázky tak, že je zobrazovaly v samostatných oknech; a to většinou potom, co uživatel kliknul na odkaz pro jeho zobrazení. Integrací obrázků přímo do dokumentu, včetně zalomení textu kolem něj, se Web, slovy Tima Bernerse-Lee <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"BERNERS-LEE, Frequently asked questions\" id=\"return-note-511-13\" href=\"#note-511-13\"><sup>13</sup></a> , rázem stal atraktivnějším a svůdnějším místem. Pokud bychom zasadili Mosaic do kontextu oboru web designu, nabízí se možnost argumentovat, že Mosaic stojí u geneze web designu. Kombinace obrázků, prvotních stylopisů, možnosti používat různé typy písem a v neposlední řadě formátování textu je totiž již doménou zmíněných tradičních designových oborů, jež známe ze světa tiskovin. Mosaic dal prostor tvůrcům webových stránek, aby ryzí utilitárnost pozvedli na estetický zážitek vyvolaný vhodným poskládáním dostupných mediálních elementů. K tomu připočtěme, že Mosaic byl portován z původního unixového kódu na populární platformy Mac a PC. Berners-Lee píše, že „[…] Mosaic byl nejjednodušším krokem pro začátečníka, jak se dostat na Web, a tím pádem kritickým prvkem pro explozi Webu“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Tamtéž\" id=\"return-note-511-14\" href=\"#note-511-14\"><sup>14</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Po neshodách v NCSA Marc Andreessen se spolupracovníky zakládá Netscape Communications Corporation a přichází v roce 1994 na trh s novým (taktéž legendárním) prohlížečem Netscape Navigator. Na trhu ale nemá jednoznačný monopol, jelikož několik společností, mezi nimi Microsoft, si licencují zdrojový kód Mosaicu, na jehož základě Microsoft vydává vlastní prohlížeč Internet Explorer <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Microsoft and Spyglass kiss and make up\" id=\"return-note-511-15\" href=\"#note-511-15\"><sup>15</sup></a>, jenž byl poprvé ve verzi 1.0 dodáván společně s operačním systémem Windows 95. Netscape a Internet Explorer se stávají dominantními prohlížeči na trhu a snaží se upoutat pozornost uživatelů. Zatímco Microsoft mohl dodávat svůj prohlížeč zdarma v rámci svého operačního systému, který nabýval na popularitě, Netscape takové možnosti neměl, a tak se spoléhal na inovace ve vývoji technologických možností svého prohlížeče. Byl to právě Netscape, který pro platformu Webu zavedl takové funkce jako rámce (frames), cookies a především skriptovací jazyk JavaScript. Odpověď Microsoftu na JavaScript byla v roce 1996 vlastní implementace nazvaná JScript. <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"JavaScript: How Did We Get Here?\" id=\"return-note-511-16\" href=\"#note-511-16\"><sup>16</sup></a></p>\n<p>Konfrontace mezi těmito prohlížeči sílila a toto období se taktéž vhodně nazývá „válkami prohlížečů“. Udržení konkurenceschopnosti a vlivu na trhu podnítilo vývojáře k dalším inovacím. Vynořily se nové technologie a funkcionality: vylepšení možností kaskádových stylů, koncept dynamického HTML či technologie AJAX, která byla vytvořena společností Microsoft pro prohlížeče Internet Explorer 5 a následně popularizována teoreticky ve vlivném článku Jesse Garreta z konzultační společnosti Adaptive Path <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"JAMES GARRETT, Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications\" id=\"return-note-511-17\" href=\"#note-511-17\"><sup>17</sup></a> a prakticky např. v aplikacích společnosti Google. Následné války prohlížečů probíhaly i potom, co vliv Netscape upadl a jeho kód se stal open source základem pro prohlížeč Mozilla: objevily se nové prohlížeče Opera, Safari či později Chrome; Internet Explorer, se svou dominancí na trhu a neochotou implementovat chování dle standardů, se stal postrachem a noční můrou web designérů, ale i vývojářů, kteří pod nátlakem od designérů i nadřízených byli nuceni implementovat návrh webové stránky pro prohlížeče disparátních a idiosynkratických funkcionalit a typů chování.</p>\n<p>Stejně jako v případě GML, kdy různé a od sebe se lišící implementace vyžadovaly sjednocení a standardizaci, jež vyústila v SGML, tak i u webových technologií začali výrobci prohlížečů a weboví vývojáři chápat, že určitá míra centralizace a dohody je nutná, pokud „Web měl dosáhnout svého plného potenciálu“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"„Vést Web ke svému plnému potenciálu“ je oficiální motto konsorcia W3C\" id=\"return-note-511-18\" href=\"#note-511-18\"><sup>18</sup></a> . K těmto účelům již roku 1994 Tim Berners-Lee založil konsorcium W3C. To dodnes podporuje dialog mezi jednotlivými výrobci prohlížečů a navrhuje svá doporučení pro implementaci nových technologií. V historii se ale ukázalo, že ne vždy byla práce W3C v souladu s očekáváním a požadavky výrobců prohlížečů i samotných tvůrců webových stránek.</p>\n<h2>Standardizace, boj o XHTML, W3C, WHATWG</h2>\n<p>Zcela prvním standardem bylo HTML tak, jak jej navrhl Tim Berners-Lee. V roce 1993, tedy rok před vznikem W3C, Berners-Lee předkládá dokument popisující všechny HTML tagy a jejich funkce organizaci Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"BERNERS-LEE a CONNOLLY, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML): A Representation of Textual Information and MetaInformation for Retrieval and Interchange\" id=\"return-note-511-19\" href=\"#note-511-19\"><sup>19</sup></a>. Po dlouhých a plodných debatách na elektronické konferenci (mailing listu) www-talk David Ragget navrhuje vylepšení původního HTML, které nese název HTML+ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"RAGGETT, HTML+ (Hypertext markup format)\" id=\"return-note-511-20\" href=\"#note-511-20\"><sup>20</sup></a>. Tato verze ovšem nebyla nikdy implementována a místo toho byla rovnou nahrazena HTML ve verzi 2.0. Následovala verze HTML 3.2, jež standardizovala použití tabulek, apletů a obtékání textu kolem obrázků; poskytovala také zpětnou kompatibilitu s verzí HTML 2.0. <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"PILGRIM, HTML5: up and running, s. 6\" id=\"return-note-511-21\" href=\"#note-511-21\"><sup>21</sup></a> W3C specifikace HTML 4 byla hotova v roce 1997. Proces, kterým standardizace, respektive doporučení, byly tvořeny, komentuje Mark Pilgrim následovně:</p>\n<blockquote><p>„HTML vždy bylo konverzací mezi tvůrci prohlížečů, tvůrci [webových stránek], šprty zabývajícími se standardy a ostatními lidmi, kdo se ukázali a rádi diskutovali o hranatých závorkách. Většina z úspěšných verzí HTML byly ‚retro specifikace‘ dohánějící svět a zároveň se jej snažily postrčit správným směrem“.  <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Tamtéž, s. 8\" id=\"return-note-511-22\" href=\"#note-511-22\"><sup>22</sup></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Pilgrim pokračuje:</p>\n<blockquote><p>„Kdokoli, kdo říká, že HTML by mělo zůstat ‚čisté‘ (nejspíše tím, že by ignorovalo tvůrce prohlížečů nebo tvůrce [webových stránek] nebo obě možnosti), je jednoduše neinformován. HTML nikdy nebylo čisté a všechny pokusy o purifikaci byly neobyčejným selháním, kterému se vyrovnají pouze pokusy o jeho nahrazení“.  <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Tamtéž, s. 8\" id=\"return-note-511-23\" href=\"#note-511-23\"><sup>23</sup></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Dodejme, že u všech dosavadně zmíněných verzích HTML vždy byla prokázána snaha o zachování zpětné kompatibility. Při uvedení nové verze se tvůrci webových stránek nemuseli obávat využít nových funkcionalit, aniž by již existující stránky přestaly zcela fungovat. Od těchto charakteristických konvencí průběhu tvorby doporučení se W3C odvrací roku 1997, kdy publikuje doporučení pro HTML 4.0 a zároveň oznamuje, že další verzi HTML nechystá; místo toho se začíná věnovat na XML založeným standardům.</p>\n<p>W3C se tímto krokem transformuje z deskriptivní organizace na orgán snažící se o preskripci toho, jak by HTML a zároveň i webové stránky měly vypadat. Cílem tohoto posunu je právě ona intervence, před kterou varuje Mark Pilgrim: očista HTML. Je pravdou, že HTML je podmnožinou SGML, čímž dědí i několik záporných stránek: SGML je příliš obecné, není možné je rozšiřovat o vlastní moduly, neposkytuje potřebné vlastnosti, které by dovolovaly jednoduché strojové zpracování. W3C se rozhodl zasáhnout a přetvořit HTML na podmnožinu XML. V roce 1998 W3C zveřejňuje XHTML 1.0. Ze specifikace je zřejmé, že tato verze nepřináší nic nového; formuluje, jak HTML 4.0 zapisovat v „XML syntaxi“, požadující uzavírání tagů, malá písmena a psaní atributů HTML tagů v uvozovkách. Tato verze XHTML specifikuje tzv. Appendix C, který obsahuje postup, jak webové stránky psát v nové XHTML syntaxi se zachováním kompatibility. Další projekt W3C z roku 1999 — Extended Forms (později také XForms) — se již kompatibility vzdává, neboť „cíle pro příští generaci formulářů jsou nekompatibilní se zachováním zpětné kompatibility s prohlížeči navrženými pro předchozí verze HTML“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"XHTML™ Extended Forms Requirements\" id=\"return-note-511-24\" href=\"#note-511-24\"><sup>24</sup></a>. Konečně v květnu roku 2003 vychází verze HTML 1.1, jež vedle minoritních novinek vyžaduje, aby každá XHTML 1.1 webová stránka byla posílána serverem ve specifické MIME <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions — konkrétně hlavička content-type indikuje typ obsahu\" id=\"return-note-511-25\" href=\"#note-511-25\"><sup>25</sup></a> hlavičce application/xhtml+xml. Jinak řečeno, pokud tvůrce webových stránek chtěl vytvářet skutečné XHTML 1.1 projekty, bylo nutné, aby dodržel onu direktivu zasílat obsah s danou hlavičkou. Otázkou je: skutečně toho tvůrci webových stránek využívali?</p>\n<p>Mnoho tvůrců webových stránek si po vydání XHTML předsevzalo, že jediný „správný“ způsob, jak tvořit pro platformu Webu, je využívat syntax XHTML. Tato metoda byla chápána jako dogma. Faktem je, že majorita webových stránek napsaných v XHTML nikdy XHTML dokumentem nebyla. Zmínili jsme, že dle specifikace musel každý XHTML dokument obsahovat příslušnou MIME hlavičku, aby byl interpretován jako XML. Problémem bylo, že dominantní prohlížeč té doby — Internet Explorer — nedokázal dokumenty s hlavičkou application/xhtml+xml řádně zobrazit. K tomu je třeba zmínit, že prohlížeče, které byly připravené pro zacházení s XHTML, také dokument nezobrazovaly, a to tehdy, pokud se v jejich zápisu vyskytla jediná chyba — toto však bylo chování vyžadované specifikací a považováno za „výhodu“ XHTML.</p>\n<p>Pokud měla platforma Webu naplnit osud, který ji přiřknuli první průkopníci typu Douglese Engelbarta — tedy platforma umožňující komunikaci a spolupráci mezi lidmi, sdílení informací, tvorbu virtuálních komunit — bylo nutné do života webových stránek zapojit i uživatele, nikoli jako pasivní konzumenty, ale jako aktivní aktéry participující na obsahu. Dle XHTML specifikace by i tento obsah přidaný uživateli musel být XHTML validní; každý vložený komentář, každé vložené médium by muselo projít důkladnou kontrolou před svým zobrazením, jelikož případná nevalidita by způsobila, že by se všem uživatelům zobrazila chybová zpráva parseru XHTML kódu. I když je zřejmé, že většina stránek obsahovala mechanismy kontrolující vstupní data od uživatelů, málokdo si mohl dovolit nezobrazovat celou stránku kvůli neukončenému tagu.</p>\n<p>Ve výsledku jsme se tak setkali se stavem, kdy mnoho webových stránek pyšně zobrazovalo lákavé ikonky informující o XHTML 1.0 (1.1) validitě dané stránky, přesto při nedostupnosti hlavičky application/xhtml+xml byl jejich obsah prohlížeči interpretován jako klasický text/html obsah, jinak řečeno, jako HTML 4.0 (4.1). Avizovaná verze XHTML 2.0 se navíc měla od HTML zcela odloučit.</p>\n<p>V roce 2004 na jedné z konferencí W3C několik členů v čele se společnostmi Mozilla Foundation a Opera Software vyjádřilo nespokojenost s vedením: oproti ostatním členům podporovalo zachování zpětné kompatibility a především tvoření nových specifikací a nových funkcionalit nikoli preskriptivně, ale na základě toho, co je skutečně pro vývojáře webových prohlížečů a tvůrce webových stránek relevantní v „reálném světě“ platformy Webu. Nesouhlas vedl k založení skupiny The Web Hypertext Applications Technology Working Group (WHATWG), zastřešovaná tvůrci webových prohlížečů (mimo společnost Microsoft). Skupina začala pracovat na několika důležitých projektech: poprvé jasně definovala, jak prohlížeče mají parserovat HTML a jak mají vynakládat s chybným zápisem; zasloužila se také o vytvoření specifikace HTML5 <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"HTML, Living Standard: 12.2 Parsing HTML documents\" id=\"return-note-511-26\" href=\"#note-511-26\"><sup>26</sup></a> . V roce 2006 Tim Berners-Lee oznámil, že W3C a WHATWG budou na dalších projektech spolupracovat. V roce 2009 byla práce XHTML 2 ukončena a zrušena.</p>\n<h2>Web 2.0</h2>\n<p>Absence zpětné kompatibility a příliš krutá daň i za jeden neuzavřený tag v kódu nebyly vlastnostmi XHTML, které by odpovídaly tomu, jakým směrem se Web kolem roku 2004 vyvíjel. Nové či znovuobjevené technologie přetvářely Web na multimediální prostor, jehož grafický interface poskytoval „bohaté uživatelské zážitky“. Vedle bohatší interakce webové projekty začaly více zapojovat uživatele do svých procesů — i díky projektům společnosti Google (Google Mail, Google Maps) a dalším jako Flickr, Amazon, Ebay, Wikipedie se Web ze statického hypertextového projektu stává dynamickým a sociálním prostorem.</p>\n<p>Tyto změny a tendence byly v roce 2004 pojmenovány Timem O’Reilly jako Web 2.0, pojem, který od té doby nepřestal být kontroverzní. Termín může na první pohled implikovat, že vznikla zcela nová verze platformy Webu, ale není tomu tak. O’Reilly se snažil zachytit právě ony změny, ke kterým Web postupně dospěl. Ve svém hojně citovaném článku What is Web 2.0 <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"O&#8217;REILLY, What Is Web 2.0: Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software\" id=\"return-note-511-27\" href=\"#note-511-27\"><sup>27</sup></a> O’Reilly píše, že Webem 2.0 chápe: zvýšenou participaci uživatelů na tvorbě webového obsahu, vznik wiki projektů, znovuobjevení souboru technologií, které jsou souhrnně označovány jako AJAX <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Asynchronous JavaScript and XML\" id=\"return-note-511-28\" href=\"#note-511-28\"><sup>28</sup></a> a které umožňují asynchronní komunikaci.</p>\n<p>V prostředí, kdy na trhu prohlížečů existoval monopol společnosti Microsoft a kde slovo „mobilní web“ vyvolávalo negativní vzpomínky na zážitky s užívání technologie WAP, mohli tvůrci webových stránek pokládat navrhování pro Web za činnost velmi podobnou grafickému designu v tištěném médiu: „malířské plátno“ uvnitř prohlížeče mělo pevně dané rozměry zadané jednotkami pixelů, hardware a software uživatelů zobrazující webové stránky se v rámci jednoho operačního systému příliš nelišil; pokud ano, weboví tvůrci se stále mohli spoléhat na to, že uživatel bude mít myš, klávesnici, monitor o uhlopříčce 15” nebo 17” a k webovým stránkám bude přistupovat ze statického kontextu pohodlí svého domova.</p>\n<p>Není těžké pochopit, proč tento stav platformy Webu sváděl webové tvůrce k myšlence, že „správný designový přístup“ pro Web je navrhování webových stránek tak, že se vždy zobrazují stejně. Weboví designéři se většinou rekrutovali buďto z řad inženýrsky smýšlejících tvůrců, případně z řad designérů přicházejících z offline světa tisku. V obou případech je přítomna konzistence vlastností, která je od těchto povolání očekávána. Bralo se jako samozřejmost, že webová stránka se musí zobrazovat na všech konfiguracích stejně. Objevovali se (a dokonce stále i dnes ještě objevují) profesionálové a designové firmy, jejichž hlavním mottem je právě tato „pixel-perfect“ preciznost.</p>\n<p>Problémy tohoto přístupu se začaly objevovat ve chvíli, kdy Microsoft ztratil majoritní postavení na trhu prohlížečů. Nové prohlížeče rychle doháněly popularitu Internet Exploreru, což nutilo tvůrce přestat optimalizovat stránky pro jednu konkrétní konfiguraci a začít smýšlet obecněji a abstraktněji. John Allsopp <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"ALLSOPP, A Dao of Web Design\" id=\"return-note-511-29\" href=\"#note-511-29\"><sup>29</sup></a> již v roce 2000 psal o tom, že je třeba přijmout Web za to, čím skutečně je: digitálním, interaktivním, tedy novým médiem. Navrhoval, že flexibilita a adaptibilita nejsou vlastnosti, se kterými by tvůrci webových stránek měli bojovat; naopak, Allsopp správně píše, že jsou jeho výhodou. Zažité praktiky se ale těžko obměňují, a tak se tento manifest z roku 2000 nesetkal s pochopením. To se ale mění v roce 2007.</p>\n<p>Apple v roce 2007 uvádí revoluční mobilní zařízení — iPhone —, které poprvé nabízí uživatelům zážitek z Webu, který se přibližuje tomu při používání stolního počítače. Zařízení to není dokonalé, ale obsahuje v sobě prohlížeč Safari, jenž implementuje většinu důležitých a moderních specifikací. Apple zároveň poprvé představuje zařízení, u kterého je dotykové ovládání uživateli přijmuto jako skutečná alternativa ke klávesnici a počítačové myši. Web se díky iPhonu stává mobilním.</p>\n<p>Mnohé další firmy více či méně úspěšně navazují na iPhone svými produkty. Podnikatelé i weboví tvůrci si uvědomují, že mobilní uživatelé se stávají čím dál tím více relevantnějším segmentem. První reakcí webových tvůrců jsou tzv. „mobilní verze stránek“. Jedná se o samostatné verze, které jsou dostupné pod speciální subdoménou. Podle tradičního názvu této subdomény — např. mobile.domena.cz — se těmto verzím také přezdívá „m dot“ stránky. Vzhled těchto stránek byl formován na základě rozměrů konkrétních zařízení; ve většině případů na základě rozměrů obrazovky zařízení iPhone.</p>\n<p>S přibývajícími zařízeními, velikostmi obrazovek, technickými možnostmi ale i tyto mobilní verze stránek přestaly být vhodným řešením. Bylo třeba vytvářet stránky, jež byly skutečně flexibilní, vhodně zobrazitelné na co možná největším počtu zařízení. Weboví tvůrci tak nezbytně museli zahodit svá přesvědčení o tom, že webová stránka musí vypadat na každé obrazovce stejně. Naopak, nyní bylo vyžadováno, aby webová stránka byla tvořena tak, aby se přizpůsobovala technologickým a fyzickým limitům zařízení: bylo nesmyslné po uživatelích chtít, aby na svých chytrých mobilních zařízeních ovládali interface webové stránky stejně jako na svých stolních počítačích.</p>\n<p>S řešením přichází v roce 2010 Ethan Marcotte <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"MARCOTTE, Responsive Web Design\" id=\"return-note-511-30\" href=\"#note-511-30\"><sup>30</sup></a>, když zavádí do praxe web designu pojem responzivní web design. Stejně jako v případě AJAXu, i Marcotte nevynalezl nové technologie, pouze vhodně kombinuje technologie již existující. Těmi jsou CSS vlastnost media query, relativní jednotky, flexibilní rozměry obrázků a jiných médií. Weboví designéři získávají metodiku, jak na mnoha zařízeních zobrazovat ten samý obsah.</p>\n<p>V roce 2011 <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"V roce 2011 Wroblewski vydává knihu Mobile first, první zmínku o mobile first ale nacházíme v jeho webovém článku z roku 2009 viz http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933\" id=\"return-note-511-31\" href=\"#note-511-31\"><sup>31</sup></a> Luke Wroblewski argumentuje, aby tvůrci webových stránek přestali pokládat mobilní zařízení za sekundární a nutné zlo; tvrdí, že navrhování pro mobilní zařízení může pomoci determinovat nejen vzhled, ale i obsah projektů. Jinak řečeno, Wroblewski věří, že přirozené limity mobilních zařízení nutí webové tvůrce navrhovat takový interface a připravovat takový obsah, jež jsou skutečně pro uživatele relevantní. Tímto vzniká mobile first přístup k tvorbě webových stránek jako filosofie, pomocí které limitů mobilních zařízení je využíváno proto, aby weboví tvůrci rozhodli, co je na jejich projektech skutečně důležité a relevantní. Na druhou stranu, čím výkonnější a technicky zdatnější zařízení uživatel pro přístup na webové stránky používá, tím více dodatečného obsahu je mu možno zpřístupnit.</p>\n<p>Snahou aplikovat a přenášet zažité úkony a schémata z tradičního média tisku na platformu Webu bylo nejen nepochopení toho, co Web jako nové médium znamená a nabízí, ale také rozhodnutí limitující škálu možností, ze kterých webový designér vybírá. Pokud weboví tvůrci nemají opakovat stejnou chybu i u mobilních zařízení, je třeba mít na mysli, že mobilní zařízení představují nejen novou formu interface, ale také odlišný <em>kontext momentálního použití</em>. I to jsou tedy otázky, se kterými se současný web design musí vypořádat.</p>\n<div class=\"post-aside-notes\"><p id=\"note-511-1\">GILLIES a CAILLIAU, How the Web was born: the story of the World Wide Web, s. 158 <a href=\"#return-note-511-1\">&#8617;</a></p><p id=\"note-511-2\">Tamtéž, s. 170 <a href=\"#return-note-511-2\">&#8617;</a></p><p id=\"note-511-3\"> BERNERS-LEE, Frequently asked questions <a href=\"#return-note-511-3\">&#8617;</a></p><p id=\"note-511-4\">Tamtéž <a href=\"#return-note-511-4\">&#8617;</a></p><p id=\"note-511-5\">GILLIES a CAILLIAU, How the Web was born: the story of the World Wide Web, s. 160 <a href=\"#return-note-511-5\">&#8617;</a></p><p id=\"note-511-6\">Zkratka anglické fráze What You See Is What You Get <a href=\"#return-note-511-6\">&#8617;</a></p><p id=\"note-511-7\">V prohlížečích nicméně nacházíme moduly, které umožňují „živé“ editování obsahu stránky.

V totalitárních režimech tato nutnost neexistuje, ba je dokonce výsostně škodlivá a na její léčbu je poddávána státním aparátem vybroušená propaganda, fyzické represe a další podobně chutná strava. Nějakou podobnou rétorikou bychom hodnotili totalitární systémy 20. století, pro které byla snad i přesná, jelikož se odkazovala na tradiční prvky násilí, které byly hmatatelné: vojenská síla, kapitalista, náboženský fanatismus aj. Okolo roku 1980 ale začíná růst něco, co všechny tyto zvěrstva předčí, je to nový typ moci, a tedy násilí. V kombinaci s rozšiřujícící se propastí mezi těmi materiálně chudými a materiálně bohatými toto nové násilí zveličuje problém, na který zatím pravice a levice byla zcela nevyhnutelně krátká: exponenciálně se projevují základní diference v nadání myslet. A tím proklamovaným násilím je samozřejmě globální síť Internet a vzrůstající informační komplexita našich životů.</p>\n<p>Vrátíme-li se ke „osvobozenému“ hlasu jednotlivce, vidíme, že totalitární politický systém byl vyměněn za totalitární elektronický systém informací. Kde v jednom byl aspoň otrokem, v druhém se při nedostatečné participaci stává ne-člověkem zanikajícím v síti relací a vzorců, které nikdy nebude s to pochopit. Ale to není sám.</p>\n<p>Žádný lidský mozek nebyl přírodou stvořen k tomu, aby analyzoval terabajty digitálních informací za vteřinu. I z tohoto důvodu byla logickým krokem automatizace nejen fyzické práce, ale i rozumových činností. Sofistikované algoritmy založené na matematicko-statistickém podkladě nyní za nás vyhledávají v krajině digitálního Universa vztahy, jež poskytují nový náhled na tu naši ošumělou realitu fyzickou. Můžeme dokonce říci, že počítač se již dávno stal kreativním, neboť jeho vhled do problémů je natolik vzdálen tomu, co dokáže člověk zpracovat, že každá jeho informace, kterou zobrazí v úhledné formě na monitoru, bude nová, hodnotná a netriviální.</p>\n<p>Máme v demokracii svobodu se rozhodnout? Jakže?</p>\n<p>Ideály demokracie se v 21. století nahromadí jako hnisavá naplavenina na březích našich žálářů: jsme uvězněni v biologickém těle, jež nebylo připraveno na tlak uvádějící nás do bezvědomí. Nač hlasy, nač rozum, když rozhodnutí jsou outsourcována do počítačových farem, jež jsou predominantně vlastněna materiální aristokrací? Peníze jsou stále mocí, ale kde v minulosti kupovaly status, nyní pohání analýzu a syntézu „Velkých Dat“, které jsou samy o sobě finanční aktiva. Vykořisťování nabírá nových úrovní. Marx měl pravdu v tom, že tu jsou dvě skupiny v binární opozici: já říkám jsou to ti, kteří mají hodnotné informace, a ti, kteří stále věří, že ušmudlaný papírek vyjadřuje jejich hlas, nedejbože rozhodnutí. Vždyť ani nevědí to, co neví, natož aby si byli vědomi toho, co nevědí.</p>\n<p>Pokud ještě nevznikla, tak jsme v procesu, kdy se objevuje nová kognitivní aristokracie. Díky Internetu nebude potřebovat Státu a ve výsledku nebude potřebovat voličstvo, neboť jak to bylo vždy u aristokracie zvykem, ta není volena. Naopak uvidíme, že lidé hlavou narazí na pravdu, že demokracie v tomto krásném novém světě není možná, stejně jako rozhodnutí jednotlivců. Lid bude škemrat, aby byl na vrchol pyramidy dosazen panovník, který bude vládnout nejsilnější zbraní: schopností rozhodovat za druhé. A panovníkem vůbec nemusí být nějaký konkrétní člověk. Na veřejnosti se sporadicky objeví tiskoví mluvčí či marketingový ředitel, ano panovníkem bude nejspíše anonymní korporace, náš nový otec, který bude o nás vědět vše podstatné; vždyť my sami jsme mu poskytli to nejdůležitější, naše data.

Jeffrey Veen <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"VEEN, The art &amp; science of Web design, s. 4\" id=\"return-note-497-1\" href=\"#note-497-1\"><sup>1</sup></a> poukazuje na to, že komunikace mezi editory a grafiky, případně sazeči, o tom, jak výsledná tiskovina bude vypadat, probíhala na základě domluvených kódů. Tyto kódy obsahovaly typografické informace o tom, jak má být konkrétní část textu vysázena. Zatímco většinou tyto kódy obsahovaly pouze konkrétní zadání typu písma a velikost, Veen píše, že většina nakladatelství měla standardizované často používané rozložení a vzhled stránek, a tudíž editorům stačilo k textu dopsat např. „NADPIS3“. Každý sazeč v takovém nakladatelství měl k dispozici stylopis, tedy seznam všech používaných a zobecněných kódů a příslušného vzhledu, pomocí kterého vysázel konečnou podobu dokumentu.</p>\n<p>Využití generického označování částí textů v elektronických dokumentech je připisováno Williamu Tunnicliffeovi, tehdy předsedovi Grafické Asociace Komunikací (GCA), jenž tuto myšlenku prezentoval na konferenci v roce 1967. <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"GOLDFARB a RUBINSKY, The SGML handbook, s. 567\" id=\"return-note-497-2\" href=\"#note-497-2\"><sup>2</sup></a> Byl to ale až vystudovaný právník Charles Goldfarb — který byl pozván v roce 1969 do IBM, aby se pokusil navrhnout informační systém a správu dokumentů pro právníky —, jenž zhmotňuje koncept oddělení obsahu od formy.</p>\n<p>Goldfarb v IBM vede projekt, který nakonec vyústí v Generalized Markup Language (GML). Pro tento jazyk zavádí pojem „markup language“, čímž popisuje „unikátní kombinaci tagování dokumentů, modelování dat a metajazyk“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Biography: Dr. Charles F. Goldfarb\" id=\"return-note-497-3\" href=\"#note-497-3\"><sup>3</sup></a>. GML je nejdříve využíváno pro interní účely IBM, ale později se rozšiřuje i mimo budovy IBM a de facto se stává standardem pro tvorbu elektronických dokumentů. Nicméně různé implementace původního návrhu GML vyžadují, aby v roce 1974 Goldfarb přispěl k vývoji SGML, které se v roce 1986 stává ISO 8879 standardem.</p>\n<p>SGML vycházelo z GML; i když přinášelo mnohá vylepšení — umožňovalo například přiřadit určitým tagům interaktivní funkcionality — nejednalo se o formát, dle Veena, který by se mohl prosadit pro osobní použití, jelikož byl příliš komplikovaný.</p>\n<h2>Aspen Movie Map</h2>\n<p>Mezi velkými projekty se jednoduše ztratí nenápadný, přesto revoluční projekt z roku 1978 vyvinutý v USA na Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Architecture Machine Group. Aspen Movie Map je uznáván jako „první veřejně prezentovaný interaktivní virtuálně navigovatelný prostor a také jako první hypermediální <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Zvýraznění autora\" id=\"return-note-497-4\" href=\"#note-497-4\"><sup>4</sup></a> program“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"MANOVICH, The language of new media, s. 224\" id=\"return-note-497-5\" href=\"#note-497-5\"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Aspen Movie Map zachycuje město Aspen v Coloradu pomocí fotoaparátu připevněném na střeše automobilu, který snímal město každé tři metry. Získané fotografie byly uskupeny tak, aby vytvářely nepřerušovaný imerzní virtuální podobu města Aspen. K procházení či spíše projíždění městem používal uživatel joystick, ale přímo na analogové obrazovce monitoru projekt zobrazoval elementy grafického uživatelského interface. V mnohém se tak jedná o prekurzor Google Maps Street View.</p>\n<h2>Apple Hypercard</h2>\n<p>HyperCard byla v 80. letech populární implementace hypertextu od firmy Apple. Místo obvyklé metafory oken ale využívala svou vlastní metaforu karet. V rámci okna aplikace HyperCard byly karty zobrazeny na sobě, a tím vytvářely jakýsi stoh. Hypercard, vytvořený návrhářem Billem Atkinsonem, můžeme považovat za první aplikaci představující koncept hypertextu a hypermédií pro širší veřejnost.</p>\n<p>Aplikace nebyla pouze prohlížečem dostupných „stohů karet“, ale obsahovala v sobě nástroje pro návrh a programování vlastních projektů. Zde tkví důvod, proč byl tento projekt firmy Apple u veřejnosti relativně populární; HyperCard pro tvorbu nabízel kompletní drag&amp;drop interface: obsahoval „abecedu“ prvků, které uživatel skládal na plochu karet, a objektově orientované programování interaktivních prvků se příliš nelišilo od zadávání příkazů přirozeným jazykem <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Příkazy byly v anglickém jazyce\" id=\"return-note-497-6\" href=\"#note-497-6\"><sup>6</sup></a>. Nabízí se zde analogie se známějšími integrovanými vývojovými platformami jako Flash IDE či jedna z nejnovějších pro drag&amp;drop návrh a kódování webových stránek — Macaw <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"viz http://www.macaw.co/\" id=\"return-note-497-7\" href=\"#note-497-7\"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Nebo lze HyperCard přirovnat k tradičním grafickým editorům typu Photoshop. Každá karta totiž obsahovala několik vrstev: grafické pozadí, vrstvu textu a vrstvu interaktivních elementů. Müller-Prove zmiňuje problém, který toto vrstvění přinášelo: „Vrstva tlačítek je vrchní vrstvou popředí. […] Kdykoli je text [v druhé vrstvě] přemístěn, je třeba přemístit i tlačítka, která překrývala text. Odkaz a tlačítko nejsou propojené.“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"MÜLLER-PROVE, Vision and Reality of Hypertext and Graphical User Interfaces, s. 28\" id=\"return-note-497-8\" href=\"#note-497-8\"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Platforma HyperCard byla natolik obecně zaměřená, že pro ni vznikaly nejen různorodé pracovní či volnočasové aplikace, ale také hry. Legendou je počin Myst od firmy Cyan, která naplno využila hypermediálních kapacit HyperCard, když integrovala do Myst video sekvence ve formátu QuickTime.</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Hypercard.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-498\" src=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Hypercard.png\" alt=\"Hypercard\" width=\"658\" height=\"528\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Hypercard.png 658w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Hypercard-300x241.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Ukázka „karty“ navržené v aplikaci HyperCard<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.creativeapplications.net/mac/the-hypercard-legacy-theory-mac/\">http://www.creativeapplications.net/mac/the-hypercard-legacy-theory-mac/</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-aside-notes\"><p id=\"note-497-1\">VEEN, The art &amp; science of Web design, s. 4 <a href=\"#return-note-497-1\">&#8617;</a></p><p id=\"note-497-2\">GOLDFARB a RUBINSKY, The SGML handbook, s. 567 <a href=\"#return-note-497-2\">&#8617;</a></p><p id=\"note-497-3\">Biography: Dr. Charles F.

Pro mnoho čtenářů byly jeho myšlenky příliš abstraktními, což bychom snad mohli přičítat Nelsonovu filosofickému vzdělání. Jeho úsilí bylo směřováno k několika projektům. Snažil se zvrátit status quo, které panovalo v počítačové komunitě a kultuře v období šedesátých let, a věřil, že počítače nám poskytnou vhodné nástroje pro to, abychom změnili způsob práce s textem: Nelson chtěl osvobodit text z ohrady čtyř stěn papíru. Během této mise tak mimo jiné definoval slovo hypertext, věnoval se principům použitelnosti a human-computer interaction o dekádu dříve, než samotný akademický obor HCI vznikl, a pracoval od roku 1960 na projektu Xanadu, který se i přes několik teoretických výhod oproti konkurenčnímu projektu WWW Tima Bernerse-Lee neprosadil. Teprve v roce 2007 byla vydána publikovatelná verze Xanadu — XanaduSpace 1.0.</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/computerlib_cover.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-490\" src=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/computerlib_cover.png\" alt=\"computerlib_cover\" width=\"686\" height=\"471\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/computerlib_cover.png 686w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/computerlib_cover-300x206.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px\" /></a></p>\n</div>\n<p>Nelsonovu dvojknihu — <em>Computer Lib / Dream Machines</em> — považují někteří teoretici <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"WARDRIP-FRUIN a MONTFORT, The NewMediaReader, s. 301\" id=\"return-note-489-1\" href=\"#note-489-1\"><sup>1</sup></a> za nejdůležitější dílo historie nových médií. Nabádal v ní uživatele z laické veřejnosti, aby se bránili diktátu profesionálů v počítačových oborech. Argumentoval, že „počítačové zážitky jsou médii, které by měly být designovány; a tento design by měl být kreativním procesem zohledňujícím publikum [uživatele]“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Tamtéž, s. 301\" id=\"return-note-489-2\" href=\"#note-489-2\"><sup>2</sup></a> . Dále prosazoval, že v budoucích médiích a systémech nalezneme design, který integruje i emocionální aspekt návrhu. Vyjádřil se též o „inženýrském“ přístupu k designování:</p>\n<blockquote><p>„Když počítačoví programátoři nebo jiní technicky založení lidé navrhují konkrétní systém bez všeobecnějšího myšlení, věci pravděpodobně nebudou jednoduché, ani kombinovatelné.“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"NELSON, Computer Lib / Dream Machines, s. 322\" id=\"return-note-489-3\" href=\"#note-489-3\"><sup>3</sup></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Hlavní Nelsonovou myšlenkou je docuverse, tedy prostor, ve kterém je možné překonat limitace zmíněných čtyř stěn (fyzického) papíru. V knize <em>Literary Machines</em> Nelson o tom prostoru píše:</p>\n<blockquote><p>„Budete moci vytvářet odkazy — komentáře, osobní poznámky a jiná propojení — mezi místy v dokumentech a nechat je tam pro ostatní pro pozdější následování. Budeme moci dokonce zveřejnit i tyto odkazy. […] Jakýkoli dokument může citovat jiný, protože citovaná část je přenesena — a zaplacena — z originálu ve chvíli provedení požadavku; s automatickým honorářem a informací o autorství.“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"NELSON, Literary Machines, s. 10\" id=\"return-note-489-4\" href=\"#note-489-4\"><sup>4</sup></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Projekt, který měl naplnit vizi prostoru docuverse, byl právě Xanadu a mechanismus odkazů Nelson poprvé nazývá hypertextem, jakožto formátování textů, jež není možné zobrazit na standardních lineárně zobrazujících médiích. Jednotlivé dokumenty v Xanadu existují v tzv. 3D hyperprostoru, ve kterém okna levitují; jednotlivé části textů označené jako hyperlinky jsou propojeny viditelnými čarami. Vlastností Xanadu mělo být, že tyto propojení jsou dynamická; pokud citujeme nějakou část textu a zdrojový text je změněn, automaticky se změní i námi vypůjčená citace. Dále mělo Xanadu obsahovat verzování a možnost zkopírováním vytvářet nové větve dokumentů, čímž se Xanadu přibližuje Engelbartovu NLS, jež toto „forkování“ také implementovalo.</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/xusp-LineOfFire.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-491\" src=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/xusp-LineOfFire.png\" alt=\"xusp-LineOfFire\" width=\"748\" height=\"544\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/xusp-LineOfFire.png 748w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/xusp-LineOfFire-300x218.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Project Xanadu: Implementace Nelsonových myšlenek o tom, jak by měl hypertext doopravdy vypadat.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Na rozdíl od Engelbarta ale Nelson vlastně nikdy svou vizi plně nezhmotnil.

Na základě těchto skečů vytvořil jeho kolega Bill English hardwarový design zařízení, jež jednomyslně při pohledu na vyčnívající kabel ze zadní části nazvali myší. <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"MAISEL, Doug Engelbart: Father of the Mouse\" id=\"return-note-483-2\" href=\"#note-483-2\"><sup>2</sup></a> Engelbartovi zásluhy ale zasahují mnohem dále, a pokud bychom zůstali pouze u myši, degradovali bychom jeho příspěvek. Akademici upozorňují <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"WARDRIP-FRUIN a Nick MONTFORT, The NewMediaReader, s. 93\" id=\"return-note-483-3\" href=\"#note-483-3\"><sup>3</sup></a>, že i když z dnešního pohledu je Engelbart v širší komunitě studentů a historiků nových médií znám jako „tvůrce myši“, můžeme ho stejně dobře považovat za vynálezce definujících vlastností počítačového interface dneška, metafory oken v grafickém uživatelském interface a textového procesoru <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Tamtéž, s. 93\" id=\"return-note-483-4\" href=\"#note-483-4\"><sup>4</sup></a>. Dále Engelbart:</p>\n<blockquote><p>„[… ] pomohl se založením sítě Internet; podnikl výzkum v tom, jak počítač může podpořit pracovní spolupráci; jako první předvedl videokonferenci a textové-grafické obrazovky; vytvořil editor pro strukturované programování a v 60. letech použil vzdálené volání procedur; a nezávisle vynalezl hyperlink v době, kdy na stejné myšlence pracoval Ted Nelson.“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Tamtéž, s. 93\" id=\"return-note-483-5\" href=\"#note-483-5\"><sup>5</sup></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Hlavním filosofickým programem Engelbarta byla touha najít způsob, jak vyřešit komplexní otázky lidské společnosti. Komplexními otázkami myslel problémy, se kterými se potýkají profesionální obory vědců, právníků a designérů, jejichž řešení vyžaduje kromě sofistikovaných metod i intuici, pokus-omyl a „cit pro situaci“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"ENGELBART, Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework, s. 95\" id=\"return-note-483-6\" href=\"#note-483-6\"><sup>6</sup></a> . Z pohledu naší analýzy ze sekce o designu snad můžeme říci, že Engelbart se ve skutečnosti pokoušel najít prostředek či nástroj pro řešení <em>wicked problémů.</em> Jako vystudovaný inženýr přemýšlel, jak by mohl lidstvu prospět. Inspirován Bushovým článkem z roku 1945 <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Biography of Douglas Engelbart\" id=\"return-note-483-7\" href=\"#note-483-7\"><sup>7</sup></a>, Engelbart věřil, že mnoho problémů je způsobeno nevhodnou distribucí znalostí. Svůj zrak tak upřel na technologii, jelikož ji považoval za hlavní nástroj, jak „rozšířit lidský intelekt“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Rozšíření lidského intelektu je Engelbartův hlavní program, který se později zhmotňuje v podobě NLS systému. Anglická verze této fráze je obsažena v samotném názvu článku Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework.\" id=\"return-note-483-8\" href=\"#note-483-8\"><sup>8</sup></a>. Francouzský sociolog technologie a historik počátků hypertextu, Thierry Bardini, poznamenává, že, jako mnoho intelektuálů té doby, Engelbart byl ovlivněn teoriemi lingvistické relativity <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Tzv. Sapir-Whorfova hypotéza tvrdí, že lidé interpretují svět odlišně závisle na prostředcích, které jim jazyk poskytuje pro vnímání světa.\" id=\"return-note-483-9\" href=\"#note-483-9\"><sup>9</sup></a>, a tím se domníval, že „technologické systémy jsou nejen formovány lidmi, ale samy také lidské myšlení tvarují“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"BARDINI a FRIEDEWALD, Chronicle of the Death of a Laboratory: Douglas Engelbart and the Failure of the Knowledge Workshop, s. 193\" id=\"return-note-483-10\" href=\"#note-483-10\"><sup>10</sup></a>. Engelbartovým úkolem bylo navrhnout řešení, které bude nejen rozšířením lidského intelektu, ale i oním suplementem lidské paměti, po kterém dříve volal Bush.</p>\n<p>V roce 1957 získává pozici na Stanfordském výzkumném institutu (SRI), kde se o dva roky později stává ředitelem Výzkumného centra pro rozšíření <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Augmentation Research Center\" id=\"return-note-483-11\" href=\"#note-483-11\"><sup>11</sup></a> (ARC). Právě zde vzniká design a vývoj revolučního NLS systému; při vývoji jednotlivých komponent tohoto systému vyvíjí Engelbarterův tým tak zásadní technologie jako <em>bitmapovou obrazovku</em>, již zmiňovanou počítačovou myš, hypertext, nástroje pro spolupráci týmu (tzv. groupware včetně podpory telekonference a sdílení obrazovky) a prekurzor grafického uživatelského interface. <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Biography of Douglas Engelbart\" id=\"return-note-483-12\" href=\"#note-483-12\"><sup>12</sup></a> Engelbartovo místo ve Stanfordském institutu je významné i z toho důvodu, že právě mezi jeho laboratoří a laboratoří Leonarda Kleinrocka v UCLA <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"University of California, Los Angeles\" id=\"return-note-483-13\" href=\"#note-483-13\"><sup>13</sup></a> vznikly v roce 1969 počáteční dva uzly tehdy nové sítě ARPANET, předchůdce Internetu.</p>\n<p>Hlavní Engelbartův projekt — NLS — vznikl v přesvědčení, že obrazovky počítačů by mohly sloužit i pro zobrazení textu. Ty až do pozdních padesátých let byly výlučně používány pro vojenské účely, konkrétně pro obranný radarový systém SAGE <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"FRIEDEWALD, Der Computer als Werkzeug und Medium: die geistigen und technischen Wurzeln des Personal Computers, s. 95\" id=\"return-note-483-14\" href=\"#note-483-14\"><sup>14</sup></a> . V době, kdy NLS vznikal, Internet ani ARPANET neexistovaly, proto „online“ v šedesátých letech neznamenalo „býti na síti“, ale možnost se systémem operovat interaktivně. <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"MÜLLER-PROVE, Vision and Reality of Hypertext and Graphical User Interfaces, s. 7\" id=\"return-note-483-15\" href=\"#note-483-15\"><sup>15</sup></a> Toho bylo dosaženo využitím počítačů sds 940, které uživatelům nabízely „sdílení času“, tedy schopnost počítače obsluhovat interaktivně několik uživatelů najednou. Každá stránka NLS byla strukturována do odstavců textů o dané délce. Na každý odstavec bylo možné individuálně směřovat pomocí „identifikačních odkazů“. NLS obsahovalo tři možné způsoby, jak na odstavce odkazovat: podle relativní pozice v textu; podle unikátního (absolutního) identifikátoru, který byl generován pro každý odstavec; nakonec podle libovolných textových řetězců, jež se nejvíce podobají „tagům“ využívaných na sociálních sítích. Systém NLS dále integroval funkce emailu a deníkových záznamů. Moduly emailu i deníku využívaly možnost propojovat jednotlivé konverzace a myšlenky se zmíněnými odkazy, čímž naplňovaly hlavní Engelbartův filosofický program: navrhnout projekt, který by umožnil lepší spolupráci mezi lidmi.</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nepojmenovaný-obrázek.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-484\" src=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nepojmenovaný-obrázek.png\" alt=\"Nepojmenovaný obrázek\" width=\"751\" height=\"586\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nepojmenovaný-obrázek.png 751w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nepojmenovaný-obrázek-300x234.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Inženýr Bill English předvádí systém NLS<br />\nWEBER, <em>CHM Fellow Douglas C.

Zmiňuje se o vědci a vynálezci Nikolovi Teslovi, který již v roce 1908 přemítal nad technologií, která „umožní obchodníkům v New Yorku diktovat instrukce, které se okamžitě objeví v tištěné podobě v jeho kanceláři v Londýně“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"KLEINROCK, An Early History of the Internet, s. 26\" id=\"return-note-469-1\" href=\"#note-469-1\"><sup>1</sup></a>, případně umožní „globální přístup k jakémukoli obrázku, znaku, kresbě či tiskovině“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Tamtéž, s. 26\" id=\"return-note-469-2\" href=\"#note-469-2\"><sup>2</sup></a>. Zmíníme-li „globální permanentní encyklopedii“, ve které celá lidská paměť bude okamžitě přístupna každému člověku; na které pracuje mnoho lidí najednou; která je kompaktní ve své materiální podobě, přesto ohromná svým záběrem; jež obsahuje mnoho přehledných shrnutí důležitých historických, technických, vědeckých, uměleckých a dalších faktů; která je cestou ke světovému míru, nemáme na mysli projekt Wikipedie, nýbrž vizi, kterou zapsal v roce 1937 literát H. G. Wells ve svém eseji World Brain — The Idea of a Permanent World Encyclopaedia. <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"WELLS, World Brain: The Idea of a Permanent World Encyclopaedia\" id=\"return-note-469-3\" href=\"#note-469-3\"><sup>3</sup></a> Tato encyklopedie pro Wellse znamenala možné progresivní doplnění tradičních konzervativních institucí univerzit a škol. Měla být „světovým orgánem“ spojujícím všechny lidské mysli. Je neuvěřitelné, jak se tato vize z roku 1937, snad až na onen světový mír, naplnila a zhmotnila nejdříve v síti Internet, poté v platformě Webu a nakonec v již zmiňované Wikipedii. Kde z dnešního pohledu Wellsovo proroctví tápe, je způsob, jakým si představil vyhledávání v tomto světovém mozku. Ve své eseji pouze zmiňuje, že informace by byly řazeny pomocí indexů. Nechává tak na čtenáři, aby si domyslel, jak by procházení a propojování informací fungovalo. Víme, že lidský mozek funguje na asociativním principu, tedy že není nutné se vracet do horních pater stromového indexu, abychom přešli na další informaci, ale tato informace je nám na základě asociace v naší paměti dostupná přímo.</p>\n<h2>Vannevar Bush</h2>\n<p>Sjednocení mentálních operací lidského mozku a technologie pro zaznamenávání, vyhledávání a sdílení informací se zhmotňuje v podobě zařízení Memex, jež v teoretické rovině navrhuje po válce v roce 1945 americký inženýr Vannevar Bush v dnes již legendárním článku As We May Think. Čtyřicet pět let před tím, než se tou samou otázkou bude opět zabývat Tim Berners-Lee, se Bush ptá, jak by bylo možné zlepšit práci vědců, především jejich přístup k informacím ostatních badatelů. Pokud by vědci měli přístup k aktuálnímu výzkumu, syntéza informací by probíhala na nejnovějších poznatcích, čímž by se obratem zkvalitnila a přispěla k budování informací nových.</p>\n<p>Předtím, než uvede svůj hlavní projekt — Memex —, se Bush zamýšlí, zda by samotné zaznamenávání informací nešlo zmodernizovat s ohledem na tehdejší vývoj fotografie. Bush si představuje kameru, kterou člověk nosí „připevněnou na čele a není o nic větší než vlašský ořech“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"BUSH, As We May Think, s. 38\" id=\"return-note-469-4\" href=\"#note-469-4\"><sup>4</sup></a>. Ta zaznamenává vše, na co ji vědec zaměří. Nabízí se komentář a porovnání se současnou technologií v podobě Google Glass. Bushova přenosná kamera na čele nepředstavuje nic jiného než prototyp první „wearable“ technologie.</p>\n<p>Memex bylo hypotetické elektromechanické zařízení, které propojovalo dokumenty na mikrofilmu. Bush jej nazval suplementem pro lidskou paměť naplněným všemi záznamy, knihami a komunikací, které lidé vyprodukovali. Kromě tradiční indexace podle jmen Bush navrhuje asociativní indexování jako mechanismus, který umožňuje se z každé položky přesunout na jakoukoli jinou. Memex vypadal jako kus nábytku či stůl a bylo zamýšleno, že u něj bude pracovník sedět. Před sebou měl mít dvě obrazovky, kde mohl nejen prohlížet záznamy, ale přímo je i editovat pomocí „stylusu“ a interakce s obrazovkou. Vidíme zde zárodeční představu prvního grafického uživatelského interface: Bush naznačil, že interakcí s obrazovkou zařízení můžeme měnit stav paměti počítače. Samozřejmě dodejme, že v případě Memexu se nejednalo o moderní typ počítačové paměti, ale tehdy využívaný mikrofilm.</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/YwJXAumKBl313dqhjIZ8ADOGd19qc1hGPYRBmrX27f1kTXhZqc7IFQqO76sujgBnnhpegFBSRb-4Gtq9haYSVg-kxUVPNi9w9nOBjVaMGpTsCcaUxqG5fhCBS3ySB9nN2Ozl7Sg.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-476 size-full\" src=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/YwJXAumKBl313dqhjIZ8ADOGd19qc1hGPYRBmrX27f1kTXhZqc7IFQqO76sujgBnnhpegFBSRb-4Gtq9haYSVg-kxUVPNi9w9nOBjVaMGpTsCcaUxqG5fhCBS3ySB9nN2Ozl7Sg.png\" alt=\"YwJXAumKBl313dqhjIZ8ADOGd19qc1hGPYRBmrX27f1kTXhZqc7IFQqO76sujgBnnhpegFBSRb-4Gtq9haYSVg-kxUVPNi9w9nOBjVaMGpTsCcaUxqG5fhCBS3ySB9nN2Ozl7Sg\" width=\"559\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/YwJXAumKBl313dqhjIZ8ADOGd19qc1hGPYRBmrX27f1kTXhZqc7IFQqO76sujgBnnhpegFBSRb-4Gtq9haYSVg-kxUVPNi9w9nOBjVaMGpTsCcaUxqG5fhCBS3ySB9nN2Ozl7Sg.png 559w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/YwJXAumKBl313dqhjIZ8ADOGd19qc1hGPYRBmrX27f1kTXhZqc7IFQqO76sujgBnnhpegFBSRb-4Gtq9haYSVg-kxUVPNi9w9nOBjVaMGpTsCcaUxqG5fhCBS3ySB9nN2Ozl7Sg-300x206.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Zobrazení Memexu tak, jak jej Bush naznačil ve svém článku z roku 1945 BUSH, As We May Think, s. 44</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Celý koncept by ale postrádal smysl, pokud by dokumenty nebylo možné rozumně a jednoduše propojit. Konsolidace znalostí a vytváření vlastních „cest“, po kterých se uživatel brodí v záplavě informací, je umožněna přiřazováním číselných kódů jednotlivým dokumentům (mikrofilmům). Tyto kódy nejsou zvoleny arbitrárně, ale v závislosti na předchozích cestách. Jinak řečeno, uživateli je umožněno, aby vytvářel nové cesty (jež samy o sobě představují vytváření lineárních ucelených narativů ve změti neuspořádanosti) či si zkopíroval stávající cesty, ke kterým přidá své nové poznámky a fotografie. Připomínáme, že i když výsledné cesty jsou lineárního charakteru, jejich jednotlivé části nemusí být na sobě jakkoli závislé. Odtud ona simulace asociativního mechanismu paměti lidského mozku.</p>\n<p>Zmíněné cesty jsou teoretickým základem <em>hyperlinků</em>; Memex prvotním konceptem <em>hypertextového systému</em>. Nacházíme zde ale více. Zkopírování existujících cest do vlastního Memexu a modifikace jejich částí připomíná proces velmi dobře známý v oboru softwarového vývoje, tzv. forkování. Pokud při vývoji softwaru používáme verzovací systém, není obtížné implementovat novou myšlenku, jež potenciálně může celou dosavadní práci znehodnotit. Stačí vytvořit z původního <em>repozitáře</em> novou verzi — fork. Historie opensource softwarového vývoje obsahuje mnoho zajímavých případů, kdy se fork původně vyvinul ve zcela nový a samostatný projekt. V rámci tématu této práce bude nejzajímavější fork společnosti Apple, který se z původního projektu KHTML vyvinul v samostatné jádro WebKit. Prohlížeč Firefox byl původně fork projektu Mozilla Application Suite. Nejnovější fork v oblasti webových prohlížečů přinesl Google, který po dlouhém využívání jádra WebKit pro prohlížeče Chrome a Chromium vytvořil fork jménem Blink.</p>\n<p>Bush píše, že „se objeví zcela nové formy encyklopedií okamžitě vzniklé spojením asociativních cest“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"BUSH, Vannevar. As We May Think, s. 46\" id=\"return-note-469-5\" href=\"#note-469-5\"><sup>5</sup></a>. Věřil také, že vznikne povolání zaobírající se právě sestavováním nových asociativních cest. I když se dnes nejedná o povolání jako takové, Bush předpověděl činnost mnoha tisíců dobrovolníků, kteří každý den editují a přidávají nové poznatky do největší encyklopedie dneška — Wikipedie. Nakonec zmiňme myšlenku, která se zatím nevyplnila, avšak při pohledu na současný vývoj ve virtuální realitě a oblasti zabývající se propojením a komunikací mezi mozkem a počítačem — brain-computer interface — není vyloučeno, že historikové technologie budou za pár let opět zmiňovat Bushovo jméno v souvislosti s uvedením prvních systémů poskytujících přímé spojení k uloženým informacím. Vždyť Bushova linie myšlení je zcela logická: pokud jsou veškeré smyslové vjemy převáděny na elektrický signál a činnost mozku se též skládá z elektro(chemických) aktivit, proč musíme naše tužby a myšlenky nejdříve převádět z elektrické podoby do mechanické (pohyb rukou na klávesnici), abychom je zpětně převedli do podoby elektrické?</p>\n<p>Vannevar Bush jednoznačně patří do panteonu imaginativních a originálních inženýrů. Bush si byl dobře vědom, že je jen otázkou času, kdy technologické možnosti doby doženou jeho kreativní vizi. Velké myslitele je ale možné soudit i dle toho, koho a kolik následovníků jejich myšlenky ovlivnily. U Bushe jsou tato jména vskutku velká, neboť neovlivnil nikoho jiného než Douglase Engelbarta a Teda Nelsona.</p>\n<div class=\"post-aside-notes\"><p id=\"note-469-1\">KLEINROCK, An Early History of the Internet, s. 26 <a href=\"#return-note-469-1\">&#8617;</a></p><p id=\"note-469-2\">Tamtéž, s. 26 <a href=\"#return-note-469-2\">&#8617;</a></p><p id=\"note-469-3\">WELLS, World Brain: The Idea of a Permanent World Encyclopaedia <a href=\"#return-note-469-3\">&#8617;</a></p><p id=\"note-469-4\">BUSH, As We May Think, s. 38 <a href=\"#return-note-469-4\">&#8617;</a></p><p id=\"note-469-5\">BUSH, Vannevar.

Praxe konečně dohání teorii a uznává, že design je fundamentální lidskou činností, jak přetvářet svět kolem nás. Narozdíl od chladné techniky se ale v první řadě zajímá o lidský prvek a širší kontext, ve kterém bude výsledný produkt využíván. Použitím slova kontext můžeme mít na mysli okamžitý prostor a čas, ve kterých se momentálně nacházíme. Je zřejmé, že tento tzv. momentální kontext je pouze špička ledovce. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ať už držíme pevně ve své dlani nejnovější technologickou senzaci nebo využíváme služeb městské hromadné dopravy, vždy si s sebou přinášíme vlastní tělo a předchozí životní zkušenosti. Tato nezbytná „bagáž“ nás tak zákonitě bude ovlivňovat v tom, jak reagujeme na výsledky designové činnosti, kterou pro nás úpěnlivě vytvořili páni designéři či paní designérky. Místo našeho narození, počet hodin strávených za školními lavicemi, zaměstnání, naše koníčky, ale i celá společnost, ve které žijeme, ovlivňuje, jakým způsobem reagujeme na svět kolem sebe — tyto vlivy tak nazvěme </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">širším, socio-kulturním kontextem</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. No a tyto vlivy jsou samozřejmě tak různorodé, jako je život sám. Není tedy divu, že designéři, kteří si chtějí být jisti, že jejich tvorba nebude pouze arbitrárním výplodem intuice, ale produktem pečlivé analýzy, jež předchází kreativní část, mohou být na rozpacích a ptát se: jakým způsobem pojmout všechny aspekty kontextu, aby naše tvorba byla relevantní? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Přestože věda potvrdila, že designérské řemeslo se neobejde bez velké dávky empatie (kterou jsou praktikující tohoto oboru nadáni), je mimo rozsáhlý seznam lidských dovedností pouze na základě intuitivního vzhledu náhlednout pod pokličku </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sítě</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> vzájemných vztahů, významů a hodnot, jež tvoří lidskou existenci.

Nejednalo se o nic jiného než pochopení toho, jak funguje kultura a jaké potenciální nástroje se v univerzu vědeckých metod nachází, jež by pomohly designérům pochopit kontext, pro který navrhují. Těmito koncepty byly </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Akulturace </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kontextuální přístup k designu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h4>Akulturace</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liem akulturaci názorně ukázal na příkladu, jak se za posledních třicet let změnil design hifi elektroniky. Zatímco asijské značky ještě nedávno vyznávaly zcela utilitární, funkční designový jazyk, v posledních dekádách se jejich rukopis výrazně změnil. Samotná faktická změna není překvapivá, jelikož tvarosloví produktů se neustále vyvíjí; mnohem zajímavější však je, co změnu ovlivnilo. A zde nám vstupuje teorie akulturace, jakožto koncept ze sociálních věd, který odkrývá proces, na základě kterých jedinec nebo skupina si osvojuje prvky dominantní kultury, případně kultury, do které přichází jako imigrant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Na chvíli odbočme a připomeňme si (stručně), co že je to vlastně kultura:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kultura je soubor hodnot, norem, pravidel a vzorů daného společenství, jenž se </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">projevuje u členů této společenské jednotky naučenou tendencí v konkrétních situacích </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">myslet</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">prožívat</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">jednat </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chovat </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">se podle zaběhnutých </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">algoritmů</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Pomocí kulturních </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vzorců se lidé vypořádávají s realitou, kultura zajišťuje kontinuitu ve vývoji společenství, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">identifikaci jedince se společenstvím, a tím je zabezpečena integrita sociálního </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">systému (Nový a kol., 1996, s. 11–12).</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zvýraznění v uvedené citaci jsou mé; pro design je určitě významné vědět, že onen socio-kulturní kontext, o kterém byla řeč v úvodu, skutečně ovlivňuje přesně ty lidské atributy, které jsou pro designéra zásadní, pokud chce praktikovat </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">human-centered design</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, tedy design zaměřený nikoli na technické požadavky, ale lidské potřeby a cíle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V uvedené citaci také vyznačuji “algoritmus”, jelikož se obávám, že v citované práci je algoritmus použit jako metafora, spíše než technický termín z informatiky. Víme, že jednou z vlastností algoritmu je determinovanost. Je skutečně pravda, že lidské jednání a prožívání(!) je možné zaškatulkovat do algoritmu? Jistěže ne; zatím.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zpět k akulturaci. Dále zazněly čtyři strategie, ke kterým se imigranti mohou uchýlit při styku s novou kulturou. Hojně citovaný teoretik John W. Berry (Berry, 2001) popisuje, že imigranti: </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">se mohou </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">integrovat </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a stát se součástí multikulturní společnost, ačkoli si imigranti zachovávají prvky své původní kultury</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">asimilaci </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mluvíme tehdy, když se imigranti zcela vzdávají své původní kultury a přijímají dominantní kultury nového prostředí</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ke strategii </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">separace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> se nověpříchozí uchylují, pokud si zachovávají svou kultury a vyhýbají se dominantní kultuře</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marginalizací</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> pak myslíme strategii, kdy imigrant „nemá zájem o zachování svého původního charakteru a zároveň se neúčastní interakcí s jinými kulturami, tedy i s kulturou dominantní“ (Matysová, 2012, s. 25)</span></i></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jelikož akulturace předpokládá, že se jedná o proces, na kterém se podílí minimálně dvě strany (dominantní a minoritní skupina), Berry definuje i strategie, které musí dominantní skupina zaujímat, aby imigranti měli v první řadě možnost si vybrat, jak se do nové kultury zapojí. Zrcadlově tak Berry používá pojmy </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multikulturalismus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">melting pot</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">segregace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exkluze</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> podle toho, jak otevřená či uzavřená je dominantní společnost směrem k migrantům. Pro vizualizaci vztahů mezi strategiemi přikládám následující obrázek:</span></p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pasted-image-0.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-428\" src=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pasted-image-0.png\" alt=\"Zdroj: Berry, 2001, s. 618.\" width=\"1137\" height=\"587\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pasted-image-0.png 1137w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pasted-image-0-300x155.png 300w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pasted-image-0-1024x529.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1137px) 100vw, 1137px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Zdroj: Berry, 2001, s. 618.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mohli bychom se ptát, jak se </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">akulturace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> liší od prosté asimilace nebo změny kultury. Již samotná anglická předpona —</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ac</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, alternativa k latinské —</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ad</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, napovídá, že tento koncept se zajímá především o průběh, kdy se dvě či více kultur setkávají, vzájemně ovlivňují a postupně upravují své chování. Sociálněvědní disciplíny zabývající se akulturací tak poskytují teoretický rámec, který by měl osvětlit dynamické změny probíhající právě při migraci. Co z toho ale vyplývá pro design?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokud chápeme design jako kreativní disciplínu, která formuje v určitém kontextu nový (lidský) význam pro jinak sémanticky neutrální technologii, hned nás napadne, že akulturace je potenciálně užitečný nástroj v globalizovaném světě, kde mnoho kultur je v každém okamžiku ve vzájemném střetávání. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nehledě na to, že migrace je jedním z nejtěžších okamžiků, které se v životě jedince či skupiny naskytnou; a to nejen kvůli bariérám v komunikaci. Zde design může zaskočit politiku a odstranit stereotypy díky své schopnosti empatické komunikace. Ptejme se: můžeme </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">designovat</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sociální procesy tak, abychom jim dodali na lidskosti tam, kde strach a xenofobie si lebedí?</span></p>\n<h4><b>Akulturace a Geert Hofstede</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dále na přednášce byl probírán nizozemský sociální psycholog Geert Hofstede. V 80. letech Hofstede pracoval pro mezinárodního giganta IBM jako výzkumník managementu. S notnou dávkou štěstí se k němu dostaly data přibližně 100 000 zaměstnanců lokálních poboček IBM z více než 50 zemí. Tyto data pocházela z dotazníků, ve kterých se IBM zajímalo, jaké hodnoty si zaměstnanci asociují se svým pracovním místem. Zatímco data na úrovni jednotlivců se ukázala jako matoucí, Hosftede rozpoznal, že pokud na data bude nahlížet na úrovni států, lze rozpoznat profily jednotlivých kultur a jak se staví k těmto otázkám:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">závislost na nadřízených</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">potřeba jasně daných pravidel a předpovídatelného prostředí</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rovnováha mezi cílemi jednotlivců a závislosti na podniku</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rovnováha mezi potřebami jednotlivců (kariéra, peníze) a sociálních skupin (spolupráce, společně prostředí pro život)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ve své knize Culture’s consequences z roku 1980 Hofstede aplikováním faktorové analýzy IBM dat, ale i následných výzkumů, specifikoval čtyři rozměry, které souvisejí s postoji a hodnotami kultur (Willerton, s. 102):</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Maskulinita/feminita</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — kultury můžeme rozdělit podle vlastností, jichž si nejvíc cení. </span>Některé preferují mužské atributy, jako je výkonová orientace, nezávislost a soutěživost, jiné kladou důraz na ženské kvality, například spolupráci. Konkrétně pro Japonsko jsou velmi důležité mužské vlastnosti, naopak Švédsko a Dánsko si cení ženských kvalit. Spojené království patři k maskulinně orientovaným zemím.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><b>Mocenské uspořádání</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — tento rozměr poukazuje na upřednostňováni hierarchických nebo </span>naopak rovnoprávných vztahů. Středoamerické a jihoamerické země (např. Venezuela) kladou důraz na dodržování hierarchie, zato Dánsko a Izrael patří k rovnostářským zemím. Velká Británie se řadí spíše k rovnostářským zemím.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><b>Zamezování nejistotě</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — tento rozměr se týká postojů vůči nejistotě a rizikům. Řecko, </span>Portugalsko a Japonsko mají silnou tendenci upřednostňovat jistotu, takže rizikové chování nebývá schvalované, zatímco Dánsko nemá problém „snášet&#8220; nejistotu.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><b>Individualismu/kolektivismus</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — v tomto případě přicházejí ke slovu osobní rozhodnutí, </span>například sňatek. V individualistických kulturách je činí jedinec sám za sebe, zatímco v kolektivistických kulturách má větší váhu rozhodnutí širší sociální skupiny, jakou je i rodina. Jihoamerické a mnoho asijských zemí (Pákistán, Tchaj-wan, Thajsko) patří k ryze kolektivistickým kulturám, naopak Velká Británie a Spojené státy americké jsou jednoznačně individualistické.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">K těmto rozměrům Hofstede po dalším nashromáždění a analýze dat navrhl pátý, který původně nazval </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">konfuciánským pracovním dynamismem</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (WU) a později v roce 2001 (WU) přejmenoval na </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dlouhodobou orientaci</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Jedná se v podstatě o popis pracovní morálky a lidských vlastností, které se buď upínají k cílům ve vzdálenější budoucnosti, nebo ke krátkodobým ziskům.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">* * *</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Akulturace a teorie kultury nám definují a odkrývají mechanismy, které nám pomáhají uchopit něco tak složitého jako lidské bytí a soužití s okolním prostředím. Znalost pojmosloví nám poskytuje jazykový aparát, kterým můžeme nad problémem uvažovat. Designér ale potřebuje více. I když je teorie nedílnou součástí každé seriózní praxe, účelem těchto bodů přednášky nás určitě bylo navnadit na aplikovatelné metody, jež současná designérská praxe začíná konečně v masivním měřítku využívat. Ať už za tím stojí čirý zájem o to, jak zlepšit životy lidí, nebo jakési oportunistické naskočení na vlnu momentálně populárního pojmu, to je vedlejší. Důležité je, že zde máme přístup(y) k designu umožňující získat relevantní data o lidech a jejich životech, jež jsou cílovou skupinou designérova příštího projektu. Andre Liem do Prahy přivezl slajdy, kde nám představil jednu z voleb pro přístup k designu, který je nezbytný pro současný globalizovaný, multikulturní svět a komplexní vztahy mezi člověkem, technologií a přírodou: druhou část své přednášky věnoval Kontextuálnímu designu.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Kontextuální design</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Je zajímavé připomenout, že jak kontextuální design, tak například i participační design vznikly zcela původně jako přístupy aplikované pro návrh informačních systémů. Dokážu si vřele představit 70. či 80. léta, kdy technokraté a matematicky smýšlející programátoři vládli sektoru IT; retrospektivně se může zdá nesmyslné, že by právě tito lidé měli navrhovat </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uživatelsky přívětivé</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> systémy (jako kuriozitu mohu dodat, že zrovna nedávno jsem slyšel vysokoškoláka z ČVUT si libovat v tom, že pracuje jako programátor, protože to nevyžaduje komunikaci s lidma). Faktem je, že před nástupem největší globální sítě světa — Internetu — byly počítače a přidružené IT systémy drahou a sofistikovanou zábavou; pouštět k nim designéry se zdálo být nebezpečnou ideou. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Není náhoda, že participační design, jakožto spolupráce tvůrců a uživatelů na finální verzi produktu, vznikl na území skandinávských zemí, které mají tradičně kladný vztah k designu. Skandinávci si tak dobře navržených informačních technologií užívali o „něco“ dříve než my ostatní. Participační design je ale jednou z možností, jak implementovat do designérské činnosti tzv. human-centered design</span><b>, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">neboli na člověka zaměřený design.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tou další je kontextuální design. Jedná se o strukturovaný designový proces zaměřený na člověka, který si vypůjčuje metody ze sociálních věd: antropologie, sociologie i psychologie. Hlavní filosofií kontextuálního designu je předpoklad, že </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">design existuje v kontextu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, který bude designérovi jen málokdy přístupný vyčerpávajícím způsobem. Kontextuální design poskytuje designérovi metody, jež ho nutí přemýšlet o designovém problému jako </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">systému</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> navzájem propojených viditelných i skrytých relací. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kromě dnes již ústálených designových nástrojů v podobě <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience)\">person </a>a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_(computing)\">scénářů </a>se kontextuální design vydává směrem tzv. modelů. Pokud já osobně slyším slovo „model“ ve spojení s designem, napadne mě Don Norman a jeho popis mentálních a konceptuálních modelů: představa, jak funguje určitá věc, bude u designéra a uživatele značně odlišná; proto Norman říká, že čím více se uživatelský mentální model bude blížit konceptuálnímu, tím více bude uživatel schopný naplno využít potenciál navrhovaného produktu nebo služby.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mentální modely jsou původně teoretický koncept z kognitivní psychologie, rozhodně neposkytují metody, jak zajistit, aby se mentální model uživatele a designéra co nejvíce shodoval. Zde ale přichází na řadu kontextuální design a jeho </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pracovní modely</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, jež se vizualizací snaží:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">zachytit </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interakce uživatele</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> během jeho činnosti, </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vytvořit tzv. flow model, kde jsou tyto interakce vyznačeny</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kulturní model, kde jsou naznačeny omezení vyplývající z kultury či politiky dané firmy (státu)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sekvenční model, který analyzuje jednotlivé kroky uživatelovy činnosti</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fyzický model, který nakonec také zahrnuje kontext fyzického prostředí, ve kterém interakce budou probíhat</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"image\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pasted-image-0-1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-429 size-full\" src=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pasted-image-0-1.png\" alt=\"pasted image 0 (1)\" width=\"831\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pasted-image-0-1.png 831w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pasted-image-0-1-249x300.png 249w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 831px) 100vw, 831px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"image-description\">\n<p>Zdroj: https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/contextual-design</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Konkrétní analýzu těchto pracovních modelů si ale nechám na příště, jelikož se svou funkcí dotýkají toho, co si pro posluchače v útrobách UMPRUM připravil druhý přednášející.

Při bližším čtení je ale jasné, že obsahuje vše, co bylo v zadání úkolu; dikce textu je přesná a k věci.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zajímavější je její komentář k titulku článku:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">„Titulek dle mého není věrohodnou reprezentací těla zprávy. Zprávu shrnul pouze na násilnou část, avšak s absencí kontextu může působit manipulativně a ve čtenářích zkreslený dojem i informace o situaci.“</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zcela souhlasím s vypozorováním, že titulek neobsahuje důležitý kontext, ve kterém se poslední násilné akty odehrály. Až v polovině původní ČTK zprávy se totiž dozvídáme, že útoky noži na izraelské ozbrojené jednotky a následnou smrt Palestinců právě musíme brát v kontextu sporů o jeruzalémskou Chrámovou horu. Na druhou stranu, co vše může a má titulek zahrnovat? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jedním z požadavků na vhodný titulek je jistě stručnost a také vystižení </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hlavního jádra zprávy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. V tomto případě si dovolím tvrdit, že titulek skutečně poukazuje na nejnovější, nejrelevantnější informace. Je škoda, že se kolegyně nepokouší vedle nalezení problému přijít s možným řešením. Zajímalo by mě, jak by se autorsky s titulkem vyrovnala. Jestliže bychom chtěli zmínku o kontextu posunout v článku co nejvýše, mnou navrhované řešení by bylo neupravovat titulek, ale zmínít spory o jeruzalémskou Chrámovou horu v perexu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ve své analýze ale problémy s titulkem či perexem neuvádím. Dokážu si přestavit, že (anonymní) autor ČTK zprávy ponechal zmínku o širším kontextu až po uvedení hlavního jádra zprávy, tedy </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the important and latest first</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Kontext je navíc dostatečně rozebrán v prostřední části ČTK zprávy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Přesto spor o Chrámovou horu tvoří ústřední bod mé kritiku na adresu ČTK. Připomínám, že jsem při své analýze odkryl emocionálně zabarvené slovo „pověsti“, které u faktografické zprávy, objektivně informující o </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">obou stranách konfliktu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, dle mého názoru nemá co dělat. Citování obou stran konfliktu je samo o sobě nevyvážené a nejasné (když ČTK cituje Izrael, že něco řekl, myslí tím koho přesně? proč ČTK neuvádí vyjádření oficiálních palestinských institucí?), ale s největší pravděpodobností je výběr slova „pověsti“ úkonem autora ČTK, čímž se samozřejmě dobrovolně vzdává objektivního zpravodajství. Pokud by přece jen „pověsti“ vyšlo z pera třetí strany, byl by komentář kolegyně Zuzany snad přesný: </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">„Zpráva neobsahuje žádné komentáře ani hodnocení situace.

Odkaz na článek: <a href=\"http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/pri-utocich-na-izraelce-zemreli-nejmene-tri-palestinci/1270674\">http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/pri-utocich-na-izraelce-zemreli-nejmene-tri-palestinci/1270674</a></p>\n<h3>Co</h3>\n<p><strong>Události v titulku</strong></p>\n<p>V titulku nacházíme událost #U1, která předznamenává hlavní informaci celého článku: nejnovější útoky na území Izraele, při kterých palestinčtí útočníci (dle zprávy) zaútočili noži na izraelské občany, ve většině případů ozbrojené jednotky.</p>\n<p><strong>Perex / úvodní odstavec</strong></p>\n<p>Perex článku rozvíjí událost #U1 zmíněnou v titulku o časové informace a seznam míst, kde se zmíněná událost odehrála. Perex také doplňuje titulek o širší kontext pomocí události #U2, do kterého hlavní událost #U1 zapadá.</p>\n<p><strong>Události</strong></p>\n<p>V tabulce Seznam událostí jsou seřazeny události dle pořadí, ve kterém se vyskytují v naraci zprávy, to znamená, že nejsou seřazeny chronologicky, jak se odehrály ve skutečnosti. Ústředním tématem celého příběhu je informace o útocích, které se odehrály v den napsání zprávy. Tyto útoky jsem zvolil jako výchozí časový bod zprávy, a proto jej označuji jako T0.</p>\n<p><strong>Titulek, úvodní odstavec a příběh</strong></p>\n<p>Jak jsem již naznačil, perex vhodně rozšiřuje titulek o relevantní kontextuální informace. Opomenutí informací o čase a umístění v titulku tak nepovažuji za problematické.</p>\n<p>Zaměříme se ale na konkrétní výběr slov titulku, je zřejmé, že použitím slova „útok“ se zpráva jednoznačně přiklání k informacím tak, jak byly zprostředkované izraelskou stranu; opomíjí tedy fakt, že palestinská strana deklarovala, že aspoň některé z útoků vyvolali příslušníci izraelských obranných sil a v takovém případě by se nejednalo o útok, ale obranu. Pokud bychom chtěli nahradit titulek neutrální verzí, bylo by možné zvolit např.: „V pěti incidentech s izraelskou policií a vojáky zemřely čtyři Palestinci“.</p>\n<p>V perexu dále článek zmiňuje aktuální počet obětí z posledních incidentů. Při pozorném čtení vidíme, že ze 40 mrtvých bylo 19 útočníky; z čiště logické analýzy tohoto výroku tak lze usoudit, že zbývajících 21 mrtvých Palestinců byli <strong>ne-</strong>útočníci. Z jakého důvodu tito lidé přišli o život? Jak je možné, že přišli o život ve střetech s policií a vojáky, když, podle výše uvedené analýzy, byli ne-útočníky a nejspíše byli neozbrojení? K těmto otázkám článek mlčí a dále se jim v článku nevěnuje. Čtenář, který se nad těmito počty pozastaví, se musí domnívat, že podrobnější informace nejsou pro článek relevantní, nebo byly vysvětlené v článku jiném.</p>\n<h3>Kdo</h3>\n<p><strong>Atributy příběhu</strong></p>\n<p>Autorem zprávy je uvedena agentura ČTK.</p>\n<p><strong>Atributy zdrojů</strong></p>\n<p>Jména osob či organizací, kterých se zpráva dovolává jako zdroje, jsou uvedena v tabulce Seznam zdrojů. Jak je zvykem v tomto žánru, obsah sdělení aktéra se necituje přímo (narozdíl např. od akademického citování). Proto věty typu „Izrael říká“ či „Palestinci tvrdí“ jsou nevyhnutelně vágní.</p>\n<p>Můžeme si všimnout, že pokud se zpráva odkazuje na izraelské zdroje, zaujímá nekritické stanovisko. V okamžiku, kdy zpráva zmiňuje zdroje Palestinců, používá fráze jako „údajný palestinský svědek“ (V 8.1) nebo „pověsti“ v případě neověřené zprávy o rozšiřování informace o tom, že Izraelci chtějí převzít Chrámovou horu pod svou kontrolu (V 16.2). Slovo „pověsti“ je jednoznačně citově zabarvené a nepatří do neutrální zprávy, která by měla brát stanovisko dvou stran minimálně se stejnou pravděpodobností, tedy 50% a 50%.</p>\n<p>Ve zprávě je většina sdělení bez uvedeného zdroje; vyvstává otázka, zda takové informace připisovat posledně zmiňovanému zdroji, či nikoli. Neuvedení zdroje informací má za následek, že zmíněná sdělení působí jako fakta, jež nepotřebují kritické zamyšlení nebo komentář, jsou dána, stala se. Pokud by stejná sdělení byla jasně připsána nějakému zdroji, ať už Izraelcům, Palestincům nebo třetí straně, čtenář by si tyto sdělení zasadil do kontextu dle autorstvím zprávy.</p>\n<p><strong>Aktéři zpráv</strong></p>\n<p>Seznam aktérů zpráv je možné nalézt v tabulce Seznam aktérů zpráv.</p>\n<p>O události, jejíž čas jsme označili jako T0 a jedná se tedy o informační jádro zprávy, lze říci, že zdroje na izraelské straně pochází z velmi oficiálních míst a to: #IÚ (Izraelské úřady), #ISP (Izraelské sdělovací prostředky), ba dokonce i #IZRAEL (Izrael). Na palestinské straně vidíme pouze zdroj od #ÚÚSS (Údajný palestinský svědek střetu). Chybí jakékoli oficiální vyjádření druhé strany incidentů: Palestinců, jelikož když už zpráva cituje názor Palestinců, je to pouze skrze třetí osobu, konkrétně agenturu Reuters. Zde taktéž hraje roli nedostatečná atribuce informací určitému zdroji, informace týkajíce se Izraele jsou ve většina případů prezentovány jako informace z „první ruky“.</p>\n<p>Prezentování zdrojů informací je nevyvážené; interpretace zprávy tak může být ovlivněna citováním seriózních izraelských zdrojů na jedné straně, a na straně druhé absencí jakýchkoli zdrojů druhé strany zúčastněné v incidentech.</p>\n<h3>Kde</h3>\n<p><strong>Místa</strong></p>\n<p>Fráze, které zpráva používá pro vyjádření míst a jejich výskyt viz tabulka Seznam vyjádření pro užití místa.</p>\n<p><strong>Struktura místa</strong></p>\n<p>Zpráva obsahuje čtyři místa, na kterých se události odehrávají. Souhrn těchto míst viz tabulka Seznam míst.</p>\n<p>Jádro zprávy, tedy nejnovější incidenty a smrt pěti Palestinců, se odehrává ve městech Hebron a Jeruzalém nebo v jejich okolích. Je známo, že tyto města jsou rozdělena a Izrael je považuje za součást svého státu, ačkoli mezinárodní společenství uznává nárok Palestinců a <em>de jure</em> je považuje za Izraelí nelegálně okupovaná území.</p>\n<p>Tyto informace ve zprávě chybí. I když je samozřejmě spekulací se domnívat, že autor zprávy cíleně tuto důležitou informaci vynechal za účelem zkreslení, je zřejmé, že násilí na těchto místech není náhodné a je třeba je zasadit do širšího kontextu.</p>\n<h3>Kdy</h3>\n<p><strong>Čas</strong></p>\n<p>Výrazy použité pro vyjádření časových informací viz tabulka Seznam výrazů pro vyjádření času.</p>\n<p><strong>Časová struktura</strong></p>\n<p>Pořadí toho, jak jsou události ve zprávě zmíněné, je definováno tím, že za hlavní jádro zprávy jsou vybrané nejnovější útoky. Není ale zřejmé, zda tyto útoky lze považovat za chronologicky nejnovější události (pokud vynecháme plánované setkání v Berlíně viz V 25). V případě věty V 7 není totiž jasné, kdy přesně agentura Reuters uvádí jinou verzi incidentu. Je zřejmé, že to muselo být po útoku v Hebronu. Do jaké časové doby ale zapadá útok v Hebronu vedle ostatních ze stejného dne? Čtenář nejspíše bude sledovat čas útoků podle toho, jak jsou samy ve zprávě prezentovány.</p>\n<p>Další problém s chronologickým zařazením události čtenář bude mít s větou V 28. Zpráva se zmiňuje o tajemníkovi pro politické záležitosti OSN Tayé-Brook Zerihounovi. jelikož zpráva těsně předtím hovoří o pátečním setkání OSN, je možné se domnívat, že Zerihoun, jakožto tajemník OSN, pronesl svou kritiku na stranu Izraele při stejném pátečním setkání. To by bylo v pořádku, kdyby nekomentoval <em>nové</em> útoky. Myslí tím nové útoky od začátku října viz věta 4.1, nebo nové útoky, o kterých právě informuje tato zpráva? V druhém případě by čas této věty byl T +1, kdežto pokud se jedná o komentář z páteční schůze OSN, bude čas T -7.</p>\n<p>Neoznačení pořádí útoků a nejistý čas komentáře tajemníka Zerihouna není jediný problém s časovou orientací. Aby čtenář pochopil, kdy se zmíněná „páteční schůze OSN“ odehrála, musí uvažovat tak, že „dneškem“ v článku se myslí čas vydání zprávy. Ta vyšla 17. 10., což byla při zpětném pohledu do kalendáře sobota. Z toho vyplývá, že páteční schůze byla den před útoky. Takže sobotní útoky přišly poté, co na páteční schůzi OSN Mezinárodní výbor Červeného kříže (MVČK) a sami Palestinci žádali, aby Izrael zastavila ničení domů, jež patřili usvědčeným útočníkům (viz V 22.2), a svou agresi vůči Palestincům.</p>\n<p>Spekulativně se táži: je možné, že útoky přišlo po tom, co Izrael výše zmíněnou kritiku odmítla? Tak či onak, odpověď, pokud nějaká byla, by měla být součástí zprávy jako relevantní kontext.</p>\n<p><strong>Pozadí události</strong></p>\n<p>Zpráva poskytuje kontext ze začátku října, kdy začala další sada útoků. Čtenář se taktéž dozví statistiku obětí, ze které víme, že mrtvých Palestinců je pětkrát více. Jak jsme již uvedli, zpráva ztráty na životech uvádí pouze v perexu a dále je nerozebírá. Jelikož mlčí o nejzávažnější informaci — jak mohlo přijít při střetu s ozbrojenými izraelskými složkami jednadvacet neozbrojených Palestinců o život — čtenář by se měl ptát, o jakých útocích vlastně zpráva mluví? Jistě, je zřejmé, že zpráva útoky připisuje Palestincům. Jak mohou ale neozbrojení Palestinci útočit? Respektive čím? A jak velkou hrozbou museli být, když je plně vyzbrojené izraelské složky museli zastřelit?</p>\n<p><strong>Komentář</strong></p>\n<p>Zpráva se dle výše popsané analýzy přiklání na jednu stranu — příběh uvádí ve většině případů jako fakta, které necituje, případně uvádí pouze oficiální izraelské stanovisko; věrohodné palestinské zdroje podle zprávy nejsou; obavy Palestinců popisuje jako „pověsti“ (nejzávažnější příklad porušení nestrannosti); smrt 21 neozbrojených Palestinců nekomentuje; neuvádí odpověď Izraele na kritiku na půdě OSN, což je relevantní kontext, neboť útoky mohou být reakcí. Nakonec nacházíme ignorování palestinského stanoviska ve chvíli, kdy zpráva popisuje událost, jež bude následovat.</p>\n<p><strong>Pokračování</strong></p>\n<p>Touto událostí je setkání americké a izraelské strany v Berlíně. Kde je reakce Palestinců? Je skutečně možné, že neexistuje jediné oficiální stanovisko, které by reagovalo na již 40 mrtvých?</p>\n<h3>Událost a struktura diskurzu</h3>\n<p><strong>Koherence</strong></p>\n<p>Zpráva útokům nepřiřazuje kontext, který bychom měli brát vážně. Obavy Palestinců ve sporech o jeruzalémskou Chrámovou horu považuje za <em>pověsti</em> a vynechání dalšího důležitého kontextu jsme již analyzovali.</p>\n<p><strong>Zastření významu</strong></p>\n<p>Pokud je pravda, že izraelské ozbrojené složky skutečně zabily 21 neozbrojených Palestinců a izraelské úřady (#IÚ) toto potvrzují, existuje pravděpodobnost, že i tyto poslední útoky nebyli útoky „v pravém slova smyslu“, ale potyčky mezi ozbrojenými izraelskými složkami a třeba agresivními, leč neozbrojenými Palestinci. Toto je z mé strany spekulace, ale jelikož byla objektivita článku diskreditována, je dost možné, že události probíhaly jinak, než je ve zprávě popsáno. Základem objektivního soudu je přístup k informacím ze zdrojů, které reprezentují všechny strany zapojené do incidentu. To nám a čtenáři ale tento článek nenabízí.</p>\n<div class=\"container-fluid analysis-container analysis-container-table post-aside-full-w\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<section class=\"col-xs-12

Píší, že po libovolném úkonu mají lidé nedokonalé informace o vlastním výkonu a ještě o něco horší o výkonu ostatních. Při svém vysokém výkonu mají lidé tendenci se podceňovat; výkon ostatních hodnotí ještě o něco hůře, a tak věří, že jsou lepší než ti druzí. Pokud je výkon mizivý, chování a hodnocení lidí má tendenci být opačné: svůj výkon přeceňují, výkon druhých přeceňují ještě více, což vede k tomu, že se považují za horší než ostatní<em> <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Tamtéž, p. 13\" id=\"return-note-153-19\" href=\"#note-153-19\"><sup>19</sup></a></em></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myšlení je považováno za software našich mozků. I ten nejnadanější programátor zanechá ve svých programech, ať už z nepozornosti, nebo cíleně, chyby. Z evoluční psychologie se dozvídáme, že tyto softwarové bugy ve větší či menší míře ovlivňují myšlení každého z nás (za předpokladu, že Darwinovu teorii evoluce považujeme za pravdivou, ačkoli, dle amerického kandidáta na prezidenta USA Bena Carsona, inspirovanou samotným Satanem). V historie vědy nalézáme, že příliš velká jistota ve vlastní pravdu, neschopnost se vzdát momentálního paradigmatu postihly i ty nejinteligentnější členy lidské populace; vzpomeňme na kritiky Koperníka a Galilea nebo Alberta Einsteina, který odmítal připustit, že kvantová teorie a její „spooky action at a distance“ by mohla být pravdivá (God doesn’t play dice with Universe, vyslovil Einstein, ale kvantové provázání jej vyvedlo z omylu).

Proto i v životě toho nejracionálnějšího člověka bude hrát výsadní roli intuice, či chcete-li estetický soud dobrého tvaru. Bez něho bychom totiž jako lidstvo ještě shromažďovali informace o tom, jak funguje svět, a neodvážili se udělat první krok.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"post-aside-notes\"><p id=\"note-153-1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COSMIDES, Leda a John TOOBY.

Myšlenky referující k předchozímu textu tak nemusí být vždy jasné.</em></span></p>\n<p>V mnoha komentářích o designu jsme upřednostňovali tezi, že na design je vhodné se dívat jako na proces a také druh myšlení. Ptáme-li se ale, v co myšlenky designového myšlení vyúsťují, musíme nepochybně říci, že v mnoha oborech designu je finálním stádiem takového myšlení produkt. Stačí se podívat na průmyslový design nebo architekturu jako prototypické příklady, kde během designového procesu probíhá tvarování <i>materiálu</i> v budoucí produkt. S jakým materiálem ale pracují obory, jejichž výsledky nacházíme v <i>digitálním univerzu</i>? Jinými slovy, s jakým materiálem pracují digitální designéři, mezi které řadíme web designéry i interakční designéry, a je pro ně nutností tento materiál znát? Na první otázku je odpověděť jednodušší: designovým materiálem v digitálním prostřed je <i>kód</i>, tedy software. Druhá otázka vyžaduje trocha zamyšlení.</p>\n<p>Vyžadovat znalost materiálu po designérech nebo umělcích není nikterak kontroverzní. Dokážeme si představit architekta, který nezná vlastnosti dřeva či skla? Malíře-umělce, jenž neumí zacházet se štětcem a plátnem? Profesionálního hudebníka bez znalosti rozsahu a barev zvuků, které jeho nástroj produkuje? A co například dříve zmíněného spisovatele, jenž má mnoho nápadů, ale nedokáže je zformulovat pomocí materiálu svého média — jazyka? Exprese zmíněných oborů je umožněna materiály, které jsou materiálem zřejmým, ale i více či méně metaforickým.</p>\n<p>V obou případech nacházíme příklady, kde znalost materiálu významně přispěla ke kreativitě příslušných oborů. Jeden z nejznámějších příkladů nacházíme v malířství. Francouzský post-impresionistický malíř Georges Seurat byl velmi dobře obeznámen vědeckými výzkumy na téma barev a jejich percepce. Na základě znalosti toho, co fyzikální zákony dovolují malíři v práci s barvami, Seurat redefinoval médium i samotný obor. Vysoce inovativní směr pointilismus byl zrozen.</p>\n<p>Obdobný vliv vědy, i když méně známý a v mnoha případech přístupný pouze studentům lingvistiky, nacházíme v jazyce jakožto materiálu spisovatele. Originálními myšlenkami přispěli do obecné lingvistiky teorie českých vědců Viléma Mathesia a Jana Firbase. Byla to myšlenka „funkční větné perspektivy“, která byla v první polovině 20. století vyřčena Mathesiem a později přeformulována a rozpracována Firbasem. Podrobné shrnutí tohoto odborného tématu nalezneme např. v Duškové <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"DUŠKOVÁ, From the Heritage of Vilém Mathesius and Jan Firbas: Syntax in the Service of FSP\" id=\"return-note-281-1\" href=\"#note-281-1\"><sup>1</sup></a>; pro nedostatek místa k vyjádření naší myšlenky stačí poznamenat, že činnost výše zmíněných akademiků upozornila na fakt, že uspořádání slov ve větě není náhodné, ale ve standardních větných konstrukcích, které nejsou emocionálně zabarvené, nacházíme fenomén FSP <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Functional sentence perspective, anglický překlad funkční větné perspektivy\" id=\"return-note-281-2\" href=\"#note-281-2\"><sup>2</sup></a>, jenž ukazuje, že slova jsou uspořádána tak, že čím dále od začátku věty se vyskytují, tím větší <i>informační hodnotu</i> obsahují. Ve větě „Petr včera přišel domů pozdě“ tak nejdůležitější informací, kterou mluvčí předává, je, že Petr přišel domů <i>pozdě</i>. Pokud chce spisovatel vyjádřit pro své čtenáře, že to nebylo včera, kdy přišel Petr domů pozdě, ale v pondělí, může větu strukturovat takto: „Petr pozdě domů přišel v pondělí“, případně by ještě mohl dodat: „nikoli včera“. Obě věty obsahují stejná slova, avšak jejich pořadí zdůrazňuje zcela odlišnou informaci.</p>\n<p>I přes nutné zjednodušení tohoto složitého lingvistického jevu jsme si ukázali, že hluboká znalost materiálu/média může kladně přispět k našemu vyjadřování a zároveň k naší kreativitě. Jak se ale znalost kódu, jakožto materiálu, projevuje v práci digitálního designéra?</p>\n<p>Každé médium má své inherentní charakteristiky, které limitují, jakých expresivních prvků lze využít. Charakteristickou vlastností starých médií v podobě novin, knih je jejich ukotvenost v čase a statičnost. Nová média, jejichž exemplárních příkladem je platforma webu, jsou na základě svých vlastností interaktivní. Pokud by chtěl designér přenášet své know-how ze starých médií na nové, hrozí, že bude výrazně limitován konvencemi starých médií; nebude schopen využívat plný potenciál média, pro které navrhuje; nebude přemýšlet nad tím, že nová média poskytují flexibilitu v zobrazování, automatizaci svých částí a již zmíněnou interaktivitu. Znalost materiálu můžeme považovat za další „optiku“ naší metaforické kreativní occamovy břitvy, skrze kterou vidíme, jaká řešení jsou pro dané médium smysluplná a má cenu nad nimi trávit čas, a naopak vyřazuje nápady zcela nevhodné, technicky nemožné a tím také neužitečné. Připomeňme, že jednou z definic kreativity je, že kreativní řešení jsou <i>užitečná</i>. Čímž opět potvrzujeme, že znalost materiálu podporuje naši kreativitu.</p>\n<p>Materiálem nových médií je kód, je to jejich DNA. Kód byl a je tradičně chápán jako doména programátorů a softwarových inženýrů. Rozdíl mezi designérem a programátorem taktéž umocňuje rozdílnost v jejich světonázoru, v jejich epistemologii <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"LINDELL, Code as Design Material, s. 1\" id=\"return-note-281-3\" href=\"#note-281-3\"><sup>3</sup></a>. Po analýze teoretických přístupů k designu je příhodné popsat rozdíl těchto profesí tak, že programátoři a softwaroví inženýři řeší <i>dobře strukturované problémy</i>. <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Tamtéž, s. 1\" id=\"return-note-281-4\" href=\"#note-281-4\"><sup>4</sup></a></p>\n<p>Löwgren a Stolterman ve své knize Thoughtful Interaction Design popisují digitální technologii jako <i>materiál bez vlastností</i>. <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"LÖWGREN a STOLTERMAN. Thoughtful interaction design: a design perspective on information technology, s. 3\" id=\"return-note-281-5\" href=\"#note-281-5\"><sup>5</sup></a> Na první pohled se nám může takové definice jevit nesrozumitelná: digitální technologie, nová média i kód jednoznačně mají vlastnosti, které do velké míry definují, jaké úkony, jaké akce, jakého tvaru mohou dosáhnout. Svou myšlenku autoři odůvodňují tím, že digitální technologie se mění tak často, že vlastnosti, které nyní považujeme za zcela jí bytostně vlastní, se mohou v budoucnu díky technologickým inovacím a převratům zcela změnit.</p>\n<p>Ano, digitálních technologie se skutečně rapidně mění, díky Moorově zákonu dokonce relativně přesně víme jak rychle; tento postoj ale považujeme za nešťastný a po filosofické stránce zbytečně skeptický. Nejen technologie, ale i vše kolem nás, se s časem mění. Člověk po narození vypadá znatelně odlišně od svého osmdesátiletého já, přesto nevidíme, že bychom se kvůli vráskám přejmenovávali. Nebo se podívejme na jednu z mnoha technologií: platformu webu. Web také vypadá velmi odlišně od chvíle, kdy Tim Berners-Lee poprvé spustil na svém Next serveru první verzi této platformy. Máme pochybnosti o tom, zda materiál bez vlastností je vhodný termín. Není-li pravda, že již to, že se digitální technologie mění, je jednou z jejich vlastností? Přijde nám, že například adjektivum <i>fluidní</i> zachycuje mnohem lépe <i>vlastnost</i> digitálních technologií, nových médií a kódu.</p>\n<p>Pro praktické a edukační potřeby je nutné definovat a zkoumat vlastnosti technologií. I když se často mění, abychom dokázali říci, <i>jak </i>se časem mění, je nutné znát jejich předchozí stav. Naštěstí s námi souhlasí vlivný teoretik Lev Manovich, který se rozhodl definovat nová média jako <i>numericky reprezentovatelná</i>, <i>modulární</i>, <i>automatizovatelná</i>, <i>variabilní</i> a <i>schopna transkódování</i> (překódování). Těmito vlastnostmi automaticky disponuje i platforma webu, a proto je budeme zkoumat v sekci Web jako nové médium.</p>\n<p>Znalost kódu jako materiálu má přímé důsledky pro praktikování web designérů. Webová platforma je interaktivní. Řekli jsme, že prototypování by mělo být součástí každého seriózního designového procesu, neboť prototypy poskytují ideální způsob, jak iterativně pracovat na designovém problému. Pokud designování pro web vyžaduje interaktivitu, designéři by se měli zamyslet nad tím, zda papírové, případně jakékoli statické prototypy jsou skutečně těmi vhodnými. Design jsme popsali jako argumentaci s designovým (wicked) problémem. Pokud designový problém vyžaduje interaktivitu, měla by být součástí i naší argumentace. Schön tvrdil, že designová činnost obsahuje mnoho „zamlčených“, „nevyslovených“ znalostí, které využíváme pouze přímo <i>v akci</i>, při formování a zacházení s materiálem; věřil, že design je „konverzací s materiálem dané situace“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"LINDELL, Code as Design Material, s. 1\" id=\"return-note-281-6\" href=\"#note-281-6\"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Jsme si vědomi námitky, která se na adresu nutnosti znát a umět pracovat s kódem ihned objeví: existuje mnoho softwarových prototypovacích programů, které umožňují navrhnout interaktivní prototypy, ale i celé stránky, bez toho, aniž by designér měl sebemenší znalost kódu. Ano, to je jistě pravda. Zustaneme-li pouze u webové platformy, musíme se k tvůrci tohoto argumentu obrátit a zeptat se: Chce skutečně designovat pro platformu, která je <i>otevřená</i> a která ze své otevřenosti těží, neboť potenciálně každý dobrý nápad dneška, se může stát oficiální implementací zítřka? Chce skutečně, aby jeho designový proces byl jen tak dobrý, jak jen mu to pomocné nástroje dovolí?</p>\n<p>Náš argument se zakládá na zcela stejné logice, jakou v květnu roku 2010 Steve Jobs oslovil celý technologický svět svými myšlenkami o platformě Flash a důvodu, proč Apple dává přednost novým webovým technologiím HTML5, CSS3 a Javascriptu. Jobs jako hlavní argument, proč přístroje Apple nepodporují Flash, píše:</p>\n<blockquote><p>„Víme z trpkých zkušeností, že pokud povolíme mezi platformou a vývojářem další softwarovou vrstvu třetí strany, má to za následek nekvalitní aplikace a zabraňuje to vylepšením a progresu platformy.“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"JOBS, Thoughts on Flash\" id=\"return-note-281-7\" href=\"#note-281-7\"><sup>7</sup></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Jobs pokračuje:</p>\n<blockquote><p>„ Pokud se vývojáři stanou závislými na knihovnách a nástrojích třetích stran, mohou využít zlepšeních platformy pouze a tehdy, když se třetí strana rozhodne tyto nové vlastnosti adaptovat.“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"Tamtéž\" id=\"return-note-281-8\" href=\"#note-281-8\"><sup>8</sup></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Pohlédneme-li na dnešní stav technologie Flash a platformy webu, víme, že Steve Jobs měl pravdu. Společnost Adobe, vlastník technologie Flash, navíc tento fakt sama uznala a dnes paradoxně nabízí jedny z nejlepších a nejpropracovanějších nástrojů pro tvorbu webu za pomoci technologií, kterým Steve Jobs dal před mnoha lety přednost.</p>\n<p>Pomocné nástroje jsou užitečné pouze do té doby, dokud nás dělají kreativními. Jakmile se jim podřídíme a staneme se otroky, jenž jsou odkázáni na jedno a to samé řešení jen z důvodu „zvyku“, přestáváme být kreativními, přestáváme být designéry a pokud je kreativita inherentní lidskou vlastností (viz Chomsky), přestáváme být do jisté míry i lidmi. Proto jsme přesvědčeni, že pro digitální designéry znalost kódu, pro web designéry znalost celé platformy webu, je důležitá a nevyhnutelná.</p>\n<p>Tato úvaha s sebou nese negativní dopad na profesi, které se v oboru webové tvorby říká „HTML kodéři“. Jsou to lidé, kteří mají na starosti převod grafického návrhu do podoby kódu. Pokud se designér sám stane kodérem (vše tomu nasvědčuje), jaké místo zbývá pro toto povolání? Obáváme se, že, pokud nezmění pohled, jakým nahlíží na svou práci, stanou se redudantní složkou webového týmu. Potká je podobný osud, na základě kterého přestalo existovat povolání sazečů tiskovin. Technologie způsobila, že jejich pracná a krásná práce se stala irelevantní. Jak se stejnému osudu mohou HTML kodéři vyhnout?</p>\n<p>Věříme, že prvním krokem je nutnost přeformulovat činnost, ve které pracují a tvoří. Jejich znalosti jsou cenné a často to jsou HTML kodéři, kteří přícházejí s tím, jak využít nejnovějších webových technologií a funkcionalit. Z jejich strany je nutné začít svou činnost chápat ne jako mechanické přetváření do podoby kódu (to obstarají sami designéři, neboť jejich prototypy již budou existovat „v kódu“, případně použijí pro méně kreativní účely jeden z mnoha nabízených softwarů pro tzv. drag and drop prototypování a návrh), ale jako obor kreativních konzultantů a technických „evangelistů“, kteří budou mít nejaktuálnější informace o tom, co platforma webu dokáže. Mohli bychom poté vidět, že místo HTML kodérů nebude v kancelářích u textových editorů, ale na konferencích, kde budou za zvuků překvapení a nadšení obecenstva demonstrovat kreativní využití nejnovějších funkcionalit HTML, CSS a Javascriptu a jak jejich pomocí vytvářet esteticky přitažlivější a uživatelsky zaměřenější web design. Je to jedna z cest, jak v ekonomice 21. století stále zůstat relevantními. Jinak se nejspíše stanou obětí globalizované informační společnosti, kde se <i>dobře strukturované problémy</i> outsourcují nebo automatizují.</p>\n<p>Vilém Flusser ve své eseji Alfanumerická společnost píše:</p>\n<blockquote><p>„Nejprve bylo psaní a čtení písmen výsadou vládnoucí menšiny a potom se stále šířilo. (…) Proto mají ti, kdo ovládají čtení a psaní, nejen historické, ale i matematické vědomí; je tedy třeba mluvit o alfanumerické společnosti. Od doby renesance se začíná matematické myšlení emancipovat od myšlení historického, čísla opouštějí alfanumerický kód, aby se osamostatnil jako kód nový. Vzniká nová elita, která myslí matematicko-formálně… Čtení písmen (…) se stává zbytečným luxusem“ <a class=\"simple-footnote\" title=\"FLUSSER, Alfanumerická společnost, s. 81\" id=\"return-note-281-9\" href=\"#note-281-9\"><sup>9</sup></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Kód se naopak stává nevyhnutelnou nezbytností. A to je další, řekněme ekonomický důvod, proč brát tento <i>fluidní</i> materiál digitálního designu vážně.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Zdroje:</p>\n<p>DUŠKOVÁ,. 2005.

Jak by náš svět byl lepším místem pro živobytí slušných rodin a „stereotype-free“ myslí všech našich obyvatel! Jak skvěle by naše planeta z vesmíru vypadala, kdyby se po ní procházeli pouze štíhlí lidé, bez vrásek, od země po hlavu vysocí rovných a krásných stopětaosmdesát centimetrů, oválných obličejů, modrých očí a bloňdatých kadeří. A nezapomeňme na světlou pleť! Bylo by lépe? Byla by to utopie či dystopie? Odpověď záleží nejen na (literárním) vkusu, ale také na touze po tom hojně citovaném slůvku: diversitě, čili rozmanitosti v našem krásném západoslovanském jazyce.</p>\n<p>Snad každý člověk s ne zcela ubroušeným předním lalokem mozkovým odpoví, že taková představa reality je sice snem některých extremistů, ale pro ostatní je to velmi nepříjemnou a nebezpečnou myšlenkou. A mají pravdu, nejen, že z ryze technicko-vědeckého pohledu bychom jako lidstvo brzy vymřeli, neboť by nám chyběla genetická rozmanitost, ale rozmanitost dělá z naší planety to, čemu říkáme lidský domov: jednotvárnost, monolitičnost, kopírování připisujeme chladným, bezcitným robotům, industriální logice továrenské práce či podprůměrným umělcům, ale rozhodně se nejedná o popis vlastností, které bychom považovali za žádané. Chceme-li diversitu, měli bychom ji ale přijmout se vším všudy, tedy i s jejími negativními dopady.</p>\n<p>Již od útlého věku jsem si jako správný Čech a chlapec oblíbil sport; jako zcela originální a kreativní hoch jsem si zvolil, že fotbal a hokej budou sporty, kterým se v dospělosti budu věnovat. Jenže ještě před tím, než jsem si stačil poprvé obout brusle, jsem si uvědomil, že bota se žiletkou na spodní straně nevypadá jako bezpečná hračka. Jako každý jiný chlapec jsem již od osmi let přemítal nad smrtí, a tudíž jsem se rozhodl, že hokej vynechám, protože bych se nerad s tímto tématem seznámil z příliš velké blízkosti. Byl to fotbal, který si získal mé srdce. Začal jsem pravidelně každé odpoledne po výuce na základní škole docházet na trénink. Byl jsem statečný, měl jsem vhodné trenky, kopačky i morální kredit, přesto jsem, přes neutíchající touhu stát se fotbalovým brankářem, na fotbal nakonec zanevřel. Wikipedia totiž říká, že neexistuje brankáře, který by, i s přičtením deseti centimetrů, byl tak „vysoký“, jako jsem já. Přestože jsem v retrospektivě za toto boží nadělení rád, neboť jsem šel místo fotbalu studovat a mohl se tak ze mě stát samostatně uvažující člověk, něco mě to naučilo: díky diversitě jsem začal studovat vysokou školu, kvůli diversitě jsem se nemohl stát fotbalovým brankářem.</p>\n<p>Přál bych si, aby se zavedly kvóty pro 173 centimetrů vysoké profesionální fotbalové brankáře? V srdci možná ano, ale hlava mi říká, že je to nesmysl. Jsem jednoznačně pro diversitu, a proto mnohem raději budu sledovat v televizi toho elegána Petra Čecha, než svou bledou tvář a prořídlou kštici. Diversita se mě netýká jen v kontextu druhého nejsledovanějšího sportu v České republice; znamená také pro mě, že se nikdy již nestanu profesionálním matematickým fyzikem; znamená pro mě, že nebudu stát na jevišti jako vítěz bodybuildingového turnaje. Diversita pro mě také znamená, že mi teoreticky nikdo a nic nebrání tomu, abych se o tyto životní milníky mnohých jiných pokoušel, ale z praktického hlediska vím, že by to byl ztracený čas. Hlavou i srdcem jsem básníkem, nikoli sponzorovaným zvedačem železa. A je to v pořádku. A nikdy bych si nepřál být členem klubu architektů, který by mě chtěl za člena.</p>\n<p>Diversita znamená, že každý jsme výsledkem symfonie stále tajemných kvantových procesů, náhodných genetických mutací a vlivů našeho socio-kulturního kontextu. Nedávno jsem se opět díval na Wikipedii a zatím jsem nenašel dobře napsaný článek o tom, že by se na světě našli dvě identické lidské bytosti (ale pročítám jen články v jazykovém módu Simple Aramaic, takže i to může být příčinou). Jsme každý unikátní, a proto si příslušně lidských životů vážíme. Nebo si opravdu někdo myslí, že telencephalon Alberta Einsteina rozřezali na stovky plátků jen proto, aby se ujistili, že těch dalších dvacet klonů čekajících ve skříni je v pořádku? Ano, diversita a opravdová demokracie znamená, že naše dětské sny nejsou ničím limitovány. A ano, diversita také znamená, že každý z nás má své vlastní, přirozené i umělé limity.</p>\n<p>Věřte mi, že chápu pohnutky mnohých aktivistů, když se snaží o pro-aktivní jednání vůči znevýhodněným skupinám obyvatel. Věřte mi, že jako student anglistiky, jsem byl vždy neskutečně udiven, že Afromeričané se vůbec snaží o asimilaci mezi lidi, jejichž předkové si mysleli, že všudypřítomné biblické rozdělení černá-bílá lze aplikovat i na barvu pleti. Věřte, že chápu, že osvěta napomohla Afromeričanům, aby vůbec jejich asimilace byla možná. Aktivismus a osvěta vrhly světlo na mnohé kamenné tváře. A dnes svítí do noci i v Bílém domě. Pokud někoho v bazénu topíme, musíme tu hlavu pustit a umožnit mu se nad hladinou nadechnout, aby naše omluva měla smysl. Jakmile se ale otřepe, osuší, vynadá nám, začínají platit pro něj stejné fyzikální zákony.</p>\n<p>Chceme-li rovné příležitosti pro muže a ženy, proč stále trváme na tom, aby sport byl dělen na ty zastaralé kategorie pohlaví? Není-liž pravdou, že toto rozdělení je pouze archaickým slepým střevem dávné minulosti, kdy ženy byly pokládány za majetek a jedinou jejich aktivitou bylo učit se hrát na klavír, malovat, praktikovat cizí jazyky a starat se o potomstvo? Proč sport je jednou z mála oblastí, kde diversifikace zatím nedokázala prosáknout ve své plné síle?</p>\n<p>Faktem je, že pokud bychom toto rozdělení ve sportu zrušili a na základě naší dobré vůle konečně překonali prahistorické praktiky našich předků, nejspíše bychom ženám (i mužům) ublížili.</p>\n<p>Ačkoli některé náboženské skupiny argumentují, že naše matička Země je vlastně stále mladou a svěží dívkou, existuje rozsáhlý konsensus mezi (bezvěrci) vědci, který hlásá, že Země je ve skutečnosti matkou (ne-li babičkou) a naše lidství se mělo čas vyvíjet po milióny let. Když si představím, co matka příroda v podobě mého bývalého psa (RIP) dokázala napáchat v pokoji, když jsem si zašel pro vietnamský phó „take out“, nechce se mi ani pomyslet na to, co by se odehrálo za milión let. Příroda a fyzikální zákony tu byly, jsou a ještě nějakou dobu budou. A my s nimi. Čímž chci říci, že člověk má vlastně dva druhy rodných listů. První se nám válí Bůh ví kde, a druhý je zapsán v našem binárním kódu, v naší DNA.</p>\n<p>Současný výzkum potvrzuje, že nejsem nehybným výsledkem programování DNA; kromě genů totiž existuje něco, čemu říkají epigenetické modifikace. Ty totiž prokazují, že prostředí, ve kterém žijeme má na nás mnohem větší vliv, než jsme si mysleli. Tyto modifikace se totiž přenáší mimo či vedle genetických informací uložených v DNA (proto epi, tedy řecky nad). Člověk tak byl vystaven vnějším vlivům po milióny let; to, jak se během života choval, co jedl, jakou činnost vykonával, mělo znatelný vliv nejen na potomky, ale také na jejich pohlavní odlišnosti.</p>\n<p>Čert tomu chtěl, aby pračlověk-muž se vytahoval se svou maskulinitou a honil se den co den za zvířaty. Kdežto ubohou pračlověčí ženu nechal doma v jeskyni za plotnou a celá ta výchova pračlověčích dětí padla na její bedra, či spíše hruď. Jednomu se zvětšily svaly, druhé mléčné žlázy. Je jen historickou kuriozitou, že tomu není naopak!</p>\n<p>Zcela souhlasím, že gender a gender role je v dnešní době zastaralou koncepcí. Nikdy bych si nepřál během svého života zažít, že mi někdo řekne, že kvůli chlupům na prsou nejsem schopným básníkem, protože chlupy signalizují mužství a je přeci jasné, že ženy jsou ve verbální činnosti na tom mnohem lépe; především ve tvorbě metaforického jazyka, protože jejich corpus callosum je prostě o pár čísel větší, a tudíž jejich mozkové hemisféry jsou více propojené, což je dělá jazykově procítěnějšími a kreativnějšími.</p>\n<p>Na druhou stranu vím, že to není má zarostlá hruď, která tvoří rytmus a obraznost mých básní, ale můj mozek. A jsem zcela připraven souhlasit, že před narozením jsem byl vystaven menší dávce testosteronu, která mě připravila o kus mužství, a naopak mi dodala porci ženství. Jedná se o velice jednoduchý test, který zvládnu během jednoho dne (a ještě si stihnu vyzvednout vyžehlenou košili).</p>\n<p>Co ale nejsem připravit uznat, je přání, aby muži a ženy byli identičtí. Tedy, abych byl přesný, v demokratickém státě jsem připraven bránit svobodu pro to mít a snít jakékoli přání, ale má liberálnost nevytváří věděcká fakta. Neboť ta jsou na straně těch, kteří tvrdí (správně), že mozek průměrné ženy a mozek průměrného muže se vcelku jednoznačně liší. Ženy, muži, lidé, zvířata nejsou identičtí. Bohužel? Bohudík!</p>\n<p>Chceme-li aplikovat kvóty, tedy nutnost někoho někam dosadit, mám nápad. Existují totiž kvóty, které bych ihned podpořil a věřím, že bych získal nezanedbatelnou podporu: hlasujme pro kvóty, jež budou nařizovat, že:</p>\n<p>každý člověk má neomezenou moc a právo k tomu, aby snil, o čemkoli bude chtít, a aby na cestě k naplnění jeho snům mu nestálo nic jiného, než jeho píle, vytrvalost, talent a štěstí.</p>\n<p>Barack Obama nebyl zvolen pro to, že existovaly kvóty diktující, kolik Afroameričanů má být periodicky zvoleno za prezidenta. Byl zvolen, protože většina lidí si to přála; a to V USA, kde americký jih je stále nabubřelý rasismem.Pokud by byl zvolen na základě nějakých kvót, skutečně by Američané černé pleti slavili jeho vítězství se slzami v očích? Nejednalo by se spíše o další kontrolu, další manipulaci, další otroctví na základě kvót?</p>\n<p>Předtím, než budeme nastavovat kvóty, zamysleme se nad tím, jak fungují kategorie a hodnocení ve sportu. Garantujeme určité skupině lidí, že musí nutně mít tolik a tolik zástupců v týmu? Napadá mě akorát Liga mistrů, kde tým mohl využít maximálně tří zahraničních hráčů, ale i od tohoto se opustilo. Proč nevidíme v ženském tenise více hráček černé pleti? A proč nevidíme v mužském tenise či fotbalu více hráčů ženského pohlaví? A proč to nikdo neřeší?</p>\n<p>Dle mého názoru to má co dočinění s tím, že je nemožné systémově diskriminovat vůči někomu, kdo se již na tenisovém kurtu či fotbalovém hřišti objeví (jistě, socioekonomické zázemí hraje velkou roli v tom, zda si rodina může dovolit poslat syna či dceru na trénink; proto jsem však vyjádřil podporu „kvótám“, které nebudou limitovat snění). Tak nějak tušíme, že pokud se hráči objeví na kurtu, je to pouze na jejich čistém umu, talentu, přípravě, a tudíž nepotřebujeme zavádět kvóty na to, kolik a jakých typů hráčů se má objevit ve finále turnajů.</p>\n<p>Proč ale nezavrhneme onu kategorizaci na mužské/ženské sporty? Ačkoli víme, že ti nejlepší ženy mohou soupeřit s průměrnými muži, při srovnání s muži nejlepšími by to byl většinou nerovný zápas. A píši většinou, neboť já osobně bych rád viděl tenisové singly, kde muž bude hrát proti ženě. Přesto ale tuším, že nejde o ty jména na předních pozicích, ale jména přesně uprostřed, v průměru, jelikož podle nich poznáme, jaké výsledky můžeme běžně očekávat při srovnání obou konců pomyslných grafů. A srovnání průměrných sportovců odkrývá, že ona evoluce, trvající milióny let, zanechala na našich mužích a ženách následky. Bohužel? Bohudík!</p>\n<p>Inu dobrá, fyzická stavba těla a kondice může být jiná, jak je to ale s těmi kvótami pro pozice, kde vystačí „pouze“ využívat mozek? Slyším hlas skeptika. Vida, mohu to tedy brát, že jsme se právě dohodli na tom, že v průměru je fyzická stavba těla muže a ženy jiná, a tudíž by to bylo nefér pro průměrné ženy, kdyby musely zápasit nejen se ženami, ale i s muži? Pokud se na tomto shodneme, uvažme, že mozek je téže součástí fyzického těla osob a též prošel během miliónu let evolucí. Z toho mi vyplývá, že nemůžeme a priori vyloučit, že v našich druhých nejoblíbenějších orgánech se mohou vyskytovat takové odlišnosti, které ovlivňují naše jednání i naše schopnosti pro vykonávání různorodých činnosti. Výzkum prokázal, že naše mozky jsou v průměru odlišné. Bohužel? Bohudík.</p>\n<p>To však neznamená, že nemohou vykonávat stejně dobře stejné činnosti. Ano, to nelze vyloučit. Zdá se, že se mohou naskytnou dvě možnosti: buď odlišnost našich mozků může způsobovat, že pro určité činnosti máme od přírody jiné nadání (tedy, že porovnání průměrných výsledků bude ukazovat ve prospěch jedné či druhé skupiny), nebo i přes odlišnosti neexistují zásadní rozdíly v průměrných výsledcích. V obou případech jsou kvóty špatné.</p>\n<p>Mějme jasno, kvóty znamenají, že politicky zasahujeme do něčeho, co by mělo být otázkou profesionální, případně společenskou, nikoli politickou.</p>\n<p>Pokud ze dvou výše naznačených možností platí ta první — existují rozdíly v průměrech — zavádění kvót je protiintuitivní, neboť na pracovních pozicích jsou (měli by být) lidé hodnoceni podle toho, co umí; pokud bychom dobrovolně na základě kvót upřednotňovali někoho, kdo je méně schopný/vhodný, hraničí takové rozhodnutí s iracionálností (a to je poslední vlastnost, kterou bychom chtěli např. u politiků vidět).</p>\n<p>Na druhou stranu, pokud rozdíly neexistují, kvóty jsou též nesmyslné, jelikož stále platí, že vybíráme kandidáty na základě toho, co umí. Pokud máme před sebou dva stejně vhodné kandidáty a jednoho vybereme na příkaz kvót, jedná se o diskriminaci vůči tomu člověku, kterého kvóty neznevýhodňují.</p>\n<p>Kdy bychom tedy měli šáhnout po kvótách, kdy jsou kvóty vhodné? Nikdy.</p>\n<p>Kvóty totiž nelimitují nic jiného než naše lidství a naši demokracii. Neboť, pokud si schválíme kvóty, neříkáme tím nic jiného, než, že všechny jiné možnosti, jak se stát rozumnými lidmi, jsme vyčerpali; naše společnost selhala; je nutné si nechat diktovat nejlépe několika nevolenými politiky, jak se máme chovat. Přiznáváme tím svou chybu.</p>\n<p>Jakmile se jednou kvóty stanou realitou, stane se z nich nepříjemný precedens. Ačkoli dnes je použit pro to, co se (na povrchu) zdá jako samozřejmost, neboť sedí do určitého pohledu na svět, je nutné se odprostit od tady a teď a přemýšlet obecněji, abstraktněji.</p>\n<p>Zatímco kvóty pomohou jednotlivcům, jejich efekt ovlivňuje všechny, kteří jsou na těchto jednotlivcích jakkoli závislí. Kvóty mohou pomoci se dostat na určitá místa vhodným mužům/ženám (jež by se na ně dostali tak či onak), ale též i nevhodným.</p>\n<p>Skutečně chceme přiznat morální porážku, nefunkčnost společnosti, degradaci svobody a k tomu si za své dozorce dosadit nepovolané?</p>\n<p>Pokud ano, slyšel jsem, že Petr Čech se stěhuje do Arsenalu.

S. Eliot, evoluce a kreativita"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Že ona neposedná náchylnost ke kreativní činnosti je přenositelná napříč médii bylo dokázáno empiricky i teoreticky. Až příliš často vídáme jednotlivce, jejichž hlavní fokus kreativity je doprovázen dodatečnými svalovými vlákny vědomí, které se mohou upnout i na doplňkové působnosti. Einstein nedal dopustit na své housle, William Blake zas definoval romanticismus po peru i po štětci, Goethe byl poslední univerzální génius (Serge Gainsbourg také mnohé zkusil) a ruská avantgarda razila svou vizi všemi možnými způsoby. Nemůžeme si nepovšimnout, že kreativita se rozplývá především v podobných nádobách: vizuální umělec zakusí sochařství, malbu, architekturu, design; hudebník bude sečtělý v mnoha nástrojích; a literát může psát poezii pro vzdělané, elitní obecenstvo nebo scénáře pro masovou konzumaci pro sobotní večery. Není tak náhoda, že existuje teoretické pojednání zabývající se poezií, jehož tezi můžeme bez výčitek aplikovat na kreativní činnost obecně.</p>\n<p>Ať už Eliot psal Tradition and the Individual Talent pro kohokoli, na mne tento text působí jako manuál. Návod pro začínající, věkem neuhasené umělce, kteří pod tíhou své horké krve a rouškou bohémské pózy stále ignorují důležitý fakt: vzdělání je zásadní, ty blázne! A teď nemyslím definici vzdělání, která odkazuje k létům stráveným v zapařených lavicích školních dnů. Vzdělání vnímám jako znalost, zkušenost, poučení. Eliot říká: &#8222;Tradition is a matter of much wider significance. It cannot be inherited, and if you want it you must obtain it by great labour.&#8220; Eliot tu vystupuje jako apologeta tradice. Co má ale tradice společného s kreativní tvorbou a myšlením? Nejsou náhodou tradice a novátvorství v binární opozici? Je snad Eliot zarytým fanouškem zaprášeného tvídového saka?</p>\n<p>Platón skrze Sokrata hlásá, že poetové ve svých vrcholným okamžicích neprodukují dílo na základě technické obratnosti nebo obsáhlé znalosti; Platón tvdí, že jsou inspirováni božskou silou — Múzy jim doslova vdechly tyto mimořádné schopnosti, které se podobají stavu šílenství. Aristoteles zas říká, že dílo básníka je výsledkem racionální, cílené tvorby (poeisis). Kant částečně souhlasí s Platónem, když říká, že génius je kapacitou, která nespočívá v následování určitých postupů a je záhadou i pro samotné tvůrce. Nietzsche se paradoně blíží nejvíce současnému bádání, když říká, že kreativita je kombinací Dionýského opojení vitalitou a vášně a Apollínským rozvážným uvažováním, které usměrňuje chaos do spořádaných škatulí a forem. Jaký obraz má ale kreativita ve společnosti?</p>\n<p>Troufám si tvrdit, že prostý lid stále věří v romantické vyobrazení osamoceného génia, který tvoří na kraji společnosti, a jehož dílo je výplodem jedné mysli. Tuto představu musíme zasadit do širšího kontextu. Přibližně před 400 až 200 lety bylo umění ve službě vyšší moci, tedy ve službách církve. Umění bylo zasvěcováno bohu a to tak, že anonymně. Nebylo zvykem, že by malíř podepisoval své obrazy. Tito &#8222;řemeslníci&#8220; pracovali pro druhé; byli to nájemní malíři pokojů, kteří zdobili zdi velkopánů nebo kamenné komnaty toho pána nejvyššího. Teprve až v období romantismu se objevila myšlenka individuálního talentu, samostatně tvořícího génia, který byl inspirován procházkami po magických skaliskách zahalených v hustém, bílém oparu mlhoví. Umělec se stal tvůrcem, jehož schopnosti tvořit &#8222;ex nihilo&#8220; byly synonymní schopnostem boha. Odtud jen krůček k tomu, aby se mysteriózní akt kreativní tvorby oslavoval zcela stejně jako Genesis. Umělec se stal bohem. I když si to mysl lidu myslí do dnešních dnů, 24. prosince roku 1859 se objevilo zdánlivě nekreativní dílo, zdánlivě nekreativního jedince — vědce — které vrátilo kreativitu z nebes zpátky tam, kam patří: na zem.</p>\n<p>Fakt, že dogma staré přes 2000 let může být pokořeno jedním dílem, je výborným výsledkem vědy i samotné evoluční teorie. Jakkoli nebetyčný byl Darwinův génius, jeho On the origin of species bylo samozřejmě též výsledkem evolučního procesu. Lamarck, Malthus a Darwinův dědeček Erasmus byli Darwinovi inspirací a pozorný čtenář jistě objeví konkrétní pasáže, které Darwin též četl, pamatoval si a přišly mu vhod, když sepisoval svůj Magnum Opus. Ale zpátky k T. S. Eliotovi.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-275 aligncenter\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" src=\"http://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/tumblr_lqx2l3eD9e1qknv6ro1_500.jpg\" alt=\"tumblr_lqx2l3eD9e1qknv6ro1_500\" width=\"490\" height=\"490\" srcset=\"https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/tumblr_lqx2l3eD9e1qknv6ro1_500.jpg 490w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/tumblr_lqx2l3eD9e1qknv6ro1_500-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.jakubferenc.cz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/tumblr_lqx2l3eD9e1qknv6ro1_500-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" /></p>\n<p>Eliot svým &#8222;manuálem&#8220; staršího, zkušenějšího kolegy přesně doporučuje všem, kdo to myslí s uměním vážně, aby zanechali nenasytné ego ve skříni a uvědomili si, že nejsou bohy, ale smrtelníky. Nejen básníci, ale každý kreativní člověk přemýšlí a tvoří v určitém kontextu: ovlivňují ho historické události, či sociopolitické a kulturní vztahy. On však zpětně tento kontext také ovlivňuje. Stejně jako biologický život potřebuje prostředí (kontext), ve kterém se exprese genů může realizovat, tak i kreativec nutně potřebuje prostředí, do kterého může expresi svých myšlenkových zasadit. Toto prostředí netvoří jen látku, na kterou kreativec reaguje, ale také přirozené hranice, které determinují rozsah možných metod exprese, po kterých kreativec může šáhnout. Vedle přirozených hranic, jsou tu i hranice umělé, které si kreativec více méně volí sám. Tyto hranice jsou tvořeny aktivními relevantními znalostmi, které jsou kreativci při tvorbě dostupné; materiálem a polem působnosti. Zatímco básník může mít na základně svého oboru hranice definovány klasickou formou jambického pentametru, malíř zas má hranice v podobě velikosti plátna či obecněji média, ve kterém bude tvořit.</p>\n<p>Ač se může jevit protiintuitivně, že hranice by měly být součástí kreativní tvorby, nenechme se zmást a podívejme se na matku přírodu, jak s hranicemi nakládá. Jaké přirozené hranice jsou přirozenější, než fyzikální zákony? Že existují galaxie, hvězdy, planety a lidské bytosti, za to můžeme vděčit právě hranicím. Příroda má pro své rozmary repertoár, který je sice rozsáhlý, ale jednoznačně není neomezený. Bez hranic by příroda měla nekonečně mnoho možností, ze kterých vybrat tvar planet a podobu lidí. Logicky z toho vyplývá, že ze všech těch možností by musela existovat konstelace, ve kterých by vesmír existoval přesně tak, jak se nám jeví nyní, ale také by tu bylo mnoho a mnoho nevydařených pokusů, kde místo krás přírody by existovala jakási bezbarvá, amorfní omáčka špatných voleb. Hranice a určitá pravidla jsou tedy nutné. Mnoho pravidel ale existuje jen proto, aby byla porušena a v jejich překročení tkví kreativní tvorba, neboť pokud by některé hranice a pravidla zůstávaly neměnné, následovala by stagnace, úpadek a mediokrita a nakonec vulgárnost. Jak ale pravidla překračovat?</p>\n<p>Zde opět opakuji Eliotova slova: &#8222;Tradition is a matter of much wider significance. It cannot be inherited, and if you want it you must obtain it by great labour.&#8220; Zatímco určitá špetka talentu mající vliv na dílo kreativního člověka je skutečně zděděna, ta velká zbytková část je částí vyžadující ustavičnou a cílenou činnost: pot a krev. Ano, toto je ona idiosynkratická definice Eliotovy tradice: tradiční tvůrce je ten, který má v okamžiku tvorby v hlavě dostupnou celou genealogii děl jeho předchůdců:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8222;No poet, no artist of any art, has his complete meaning alone. His significance, his appreciation is the appreciation of his relation to the dead poets and artists. You cannot value him alone; you must set him, for contrast and comparison, among the dead.&#8220;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Eliot vidí tradici jako monumentální síť všech děl a tvůrců, jejichž individuální význam je dán tím, jak se liší a co mají společné vůči jeden druhému. Abychom mohli dílo pochopit a hodnotit, musíme jej mít před očima v kontextu děl předchozích. Čím méně má dílo společného se zbytkem oné mohutné sítě předchůdců, tím zákonitě bude trvat déle, než kritika a následně publikum dokáže dílo zhodnotit a ocenit. Toť je přeci osud mnoha velikánů!</p>\n<p>(Tato síť významů mimochodem velmi připomíná strukturalistický pohled na přirozený jazyk. Saussure ve svých přednáškách obecné lingvistiky slavně píše, že význam jazykového znaku je dán jeho vztahem ke znakům ostatním)</p>\n<p>Chce-li člověk dosáhnout velikosti, chce-li bourat hranice, překonávat pravidla a posouvat laťku, musí přesně vědět, v jaké pozici a v jakém stádiu hranice a laťka jsou. Proto Eliot nabádá, aby kreativci svou tvorbu založili na pečlivém, snad i pedantském studiu historie svého oboru, ale i úzkostlivém pozorování toho, kudy se proplétá hlavní proud:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8222;The poet must be very conscious of the main current, which does not at all flow invariably through the most distinguished reputations. He must be quite aware of the obvious fact that art never improves, but that the material of art is never quite the same. He must be aware that the mind of Europe—the mind of his own country—a mind which he learns in time to be much more important than his own private mind—is a mind which changes.&#8220;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Eliot ale ví, že takové studium vyžaduje mnoho práce: &#8222;The objection is that the doctrine requires a ridiculous amount of erudition (pedantry), a claim which can be rejected by appeal to the lives of poets in any pantheon.&#8220;</p>\n<p>A má pravdu. Jen se podívejme na tvůrce kolosálních úspěchů. Ti, jenž se stali velikány, moc dobře věděli o historii a současném dění svého oboru, ale i mimo něj. Richard Wagner byl oddaným čtenářem Schopenhauera, zmíněný Darwin byl hluboce ponořen v dílech Shakespeara, Miltona a Shellyho. Fyzik Niels Bohr nepohrdnul Goethem. No a Marx, ať už byly jeho názory později jakkoli deformovány, byl vášnivým čtenářem všeho: od Danteho po Cervantese.</p>\n<p>Štěstí, zdá se, skutečně přeje připraveným.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Že ona neposedná náchylnost ke kreativní činnosti je přenositelná napříč médii bylo dokázáno empiricky i teoreticky.

V dnešní době až komicky působí výuka programování, ve které první dva roky studenti neviděli nic, co by aspoň vzdáleně připomínalo počítač a veškeré “programování” probíhalo na papíře. Doslova. Učitel známkoval takovéto programy stylem, kdy snižoval hodnocení za zapomenuté středníky a jiné provinění, na které nás dnes během milisekund upozorní náš oblibený editor či IDE. Po dvou letech, Manovich pokračuje, skutečně uviděli počítač na místě, pro které bylo standardně potřeba míti povolení. Nicméně při zadání programu se nic nestalo, neboť Manovich (a ostatní nejspíše také) viděli klávesnici poprvé v životě a tak místo “nuly” zadával(i) “O”.</p>\n<p>Manovich se po své střední hlásil na architekturu na univerzitě v Moskvě. Aby mohl projít sítem přjímacích zkoušek, absolvoval dvouletý kurz kreslení. Námaha se vyplatila, jelikož za svůj výkres, Venera, obdržel nejlepší známku – áčko. Malovich popisuje, že jeho výkres byl mnohem náročnější než například hlava Sokrata, jelikož narozdíl od hlavy, Venera nemá dobře definované hrany. Objekt navíc musel být celý stínovaný, tedy původní pomocné čáry nesměly být vidět. Později se Malovich dozvídá, že počítačoví vědci v 1970s řešili problém, jak vykreslit na počítači dobře vystíněnovaný 3D objekt. První algoritmus, který toto zvládl byl vyvinut na univerzitě v Utahu ve stejné době, kdy Malovich začal své lekce kresby.</p>\n<p>V New Yorkou Manovich začal pracovat pro firmu, která tvoří počítačové animace pro filmový průmysl. V 1980s se jedná o jednu z prvních firem svého druhu. Manovich se učí obsluhovat počítač a software programovaný v APL. Potrvá to ještě nějakou dobu, než designér bude moci navrhnovat pomocí softwaru komplexní 3D modely a kdy Internet bude umožňovat komukoli si stáhnout již hotové 3D objekty. Software, se kterým se musí Manovich potácet, umí modelovat výsledek pouze z primitivních geometrických objektů jako krychle, válce a sférické objekty. Software pracuje s vektory a dokáže ve vteřinách vytvořit a přepočítat perspektivu. Několik obrázků, které Manovich vytvořil, se objevily na newyorské výstavě počítačového umění, ale v té době o animace či počítačové umění stál či se zajímal málokdo.</p>\n<p>V roce 1995 na nejprestižnějším festivalu počítačového umění Ars Electronica se vyřažuje kategorie počítačová grafika a nahrazuje ji “síťové umění”. Počítač není již jen produkčním nástrojem, ale slouží též k uchovávání, distribuci a přehrávání. World Wide Web krystalizuje tento fakt. Na úrovni jazyka se digitální umění zabydluje již kolem devadesátých let. Ve stejné době počítače hostují nové druhy médií: webové stránky, počítačové hry, hypermediální CD ROMy a interaktivní instalace, ve zkratce, “nová média”. V této době již není nutné trávit hodiny nad modelováním “primitivních” 3D objektů, ale o deset let později již je možné v menu nabídkách levných softwarových nástrojů vybrat mnoho předhotovených 3D modelů, včetně detailních lidských postav a obličejů. Takovýto software je navíc možné spustit na zcela běžných počítačích.</p>\n<p>Manovich rekapituluje rok 1995. Po pádu Sovětského svazu zaniklo ono napětí, které živilo kreativitu a představivost na obou stranách železné opony. Též se vytratily dichotomie typu svoboda versus vězení, interaktivita vs. předurčení, konzumní společnost Západu vs. něco, co by umělci a myslitelé nazvali spiritualitou Východu. Na jejich místo se pevně usadila kultura konzumu a komerce, velké organizace nám pomocí reklam diktují, co a jak a kdy bude probíhat či probíhá v našich životech. Je to něčím, co by umělci a myslitelé označili termínem „globalizace“.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lev Manovich popisuje jak nastoupil na matematickou střední školu, které měla rozšířený sylabus o programování, přestože se původně chtěl stát malířem.
